https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4030/,2010-11-08,IFA Issues Warning to Factories on Cattle Prices,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Michael Doran has issued a strong warning to meat factories who he accused of holding back on a badly needed cattle price increase.
He said, “factories need to make it abundantly clear to their retail and wholesale customers right now that they will not have the beef at prices less than €3.50/kg out of sheds. Winter finishers are not going to tolerate another year of losses.”
The IFA livestock leader said as soon as the grass cattle are out of the system, supplies should tighten rapidly and finishers must dig in and insist on major price increases.
Michael Doran said the factories are in a very strong position with retailers to insist on substantial price increases. He said beef is in very short supply on both the EU and world markets. World beef prices are up 50% on this time last year. There are no alternatives supplies available and the Department of Agriculture figures show that Irish cattle numbers are down a massive 330,000 head compared to last year.
The IFA livestock leader said Teagasc has produced the facts and figures on the economics of winter finishing. Nobody at factory or retail level has challenged this data.
Michael Doran said that the blatant disregard and lack of respect being shown by some factories and their agents towards farmers in buying cattle is an utter disgrace.
He said IFA has clear examples of cases where factories and their agent have bought cattle off farmers under complete false pretences.  In some cases the agent will quote a base price and the factory will pay a completely different base price on the docket.
The IFA Livestock leader said the latest move by some factories in attempting to impose a hefty weight limit penalty without informing the farmers before hand is nothing short of daylight robbery.  Michael Doran said farmers must strongly reject weight limit penalties.
He said the days when a cattle man’s word was his bond is fast disappearing among factories and agents with this type of sharp practice.
Michael Doran said no farmers should part with cattle to any agent or factory without clearly knowing the full terms of trade.  He said the base price must be clear.  Any deductions or bonus must be up front, fully explained and transparent.
Mr Doran said if an agent or procurement manager is not in a position to provide this information and explain it fully to the farmer, he should not have the job and the farmers should not sell to him."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4035/,2010-11-10,Growing Anger and Frustration over Cattle Prices for Winter Finishers – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said there is a growing level of anger and frustration among livestock farmers at the continuing failure of the meat factories to demand and secure a cattle price increase from the large supermarket retailers.
Michael Doran said Irish factories must take heed of the situation in France where angry French farmers are protesting against factories on cattle prices.
The IFA livestock leader said there is no evidence from the factories that they are demanding a cattle price increase from the market. He said “the factories appear very satisfied to continue to deliver beef to the retailers at loss making prices for producers. This situation is untenable and cannot continue”.
Michael Doran said winter feeders are not going to go through another year of losses. He said the time has come for the factories to stand up to the retailers and demand viable cattle prices. He said factories need to make it clear to their retail clients that they will not have beef at prices less than €3.50/kg out of sheds.
The IFA livestock leader said there is major scope for Irish beef prices to increase. He said cattle numbers in the country are down 330,000 head on last year and finished cattle supplies are going to tighten dramatically. Cattle prices across our main export markets in the UK and Europe are 25c – 60c/kg above Irish prices. World beef prices are up over 50% with Brazilian prices of €2.74/kg.
Michael Doran said there was never a better set of circumstances in terms of supply and demand for Irish factories to secure a major increase in beef prices."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4052/,2010-11-18,Doran Accuses Factories of Holding Back on Cattle Price Increase,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said talk of a price increase from the factories was hollow and cheap, when they are doing everything to hold back an increase and not even looking for a price rise from retailers despite the positive market situation.
He said farmers are not going to sell cattle out of sheds at loss making prices and will have to put the handbrake on supplies to secure a viable price.
Michael Doran said, “With the last of the grass cattle moving this week, farmers must dig in hard and demand a substantial price increase from factories and agents. They must make it clear they are not prepared to sell beef cattle out of sheds at current loss making prices.”
The IFA livestock leader said there is very strong demand for beef and the market is well capable of returning a substantial price increase. He said farmers are angry at the failure of the factories to look for or secure a price increase from a positive market.
Michael Doran said with the major increase in costs this year and concentrate feed up €60 to €70 per tonne, winter finishers need a price of €3.50/kg.
On the market side, Michael Doran said the UK cattle prices are in the order of £2.68 to £2.70/kg str which is equivalent to €3.33/kg at an 85p/€1 exchange rate. European prices are ranging from €3.25/kg to €3.60/kg. World market prices continue to rise with the Brazilian price now up at the Irish price level.
On the supply side, Michael Doran said the Department of Agriculture AIM figures for August 1st shows that there is a reduction in total cattle numbers compared to last year of 330,000 head. In addition, the kill to date this year is up 117,000 head and live exports are up an additional 55,500 head."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4068/,2010-11-25,Hold Now and Demand a Price Increase for Cattle out of Sheds – IFA,"IFA President John Bryan said now is the time for winter finishers to hold and demand an immediate price increase from the factories for cattle out of sheds. He said winter finishers cannot sell cattle at a loss and need an immediate and substantial price increase from the factories.
Mr Bryan said cattle prices in both Northern Ireland and Britain are rising by up 10c/kg in the last 10 days. Prices across all of the main European markets are also rising up 3c to 6c/kg. World market prices have reached record levels.
The IFA President accused the factories of holding back on a much-needed price increase here. He said demand for beef is exceptionally strong. “Supermarkets and factories need the cattle and they do not have an alternative supply base.”
John Bryan said, “IFA, together with the NFU from England, Scotland and Wales and the Ulster Farmers’ Union have called a cattle price summit in Wales for next week. Winter finishers are not going to take another year of losses. With price increases across the water, the finger is being firmly pointed at the Irish beef processing industry for holding back on a price increase.”
The IFA President said winter finishers should put the handbrake on and hold out for a substantial price rise from the factories. He said feeders cannot afford to sell at current loss making prices. Feed costs are up €60 – €70/t. Teagasc have produced the figures to show feeders need a price of €3.50/kg to €3.70/kg for cattle out of shed.
On the supply side, John Bryan said the factory kill is up 120,000 head, live exports are up 55,000 head and the CMMS data is showing 330,000 head less cattle in the country. All of this points to the fact that cattle numbers are tightening and will become very scarce."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4150/,2011-01-07,Opening of Turkish Market Positive Move for Irish Beef – IFA,"IFA President John Bryan said the move to open the Turkish market for Irish beef exports was very positive, and should help to drive on cattle prices.
John Bryan said access to the high-priced Turkish market has already had a major impact on the beef market across Europe, with an increase in German cattle prices of €200 per head.
He said Bord Bia and industry sources have indicated that Turkey could handle imports of 150,000 tonnes annually and become a major destination for European beef in the future.
Recent figures from the Turkish Ministry for Agriculture show that 80,000 tonnes of carcase beef have been imported in the last 12 months. The surge in Turkish beef imports follows a decision by the Government last Autumn to reduce customs tax from 225% to 30%."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4200/,2011-01-14,Strong Cattle Prices – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said cattle prices are continuing to rise, up 6–10c/kg in the last 10 days driven by very strong market demand, tight supplies and a determination by winter finishers to recover the increases in feed costs. He said, “factory agents and procurement managers are very active with numerous factories chasing the same cattle and some feeders saying agents they hadn’t seen in 5 years calling into them looking for stock.”
Michael Doran said the base price for steers had moved up to €3.36/kg to €3.42/kg with some top prices of €3.48/kg paid. Heifer prices have increased to €3.42/kg to €3.50/kg with tops of €3.56/kg.
Mr Doran pointed out that based on the Department of Agriculture official reported prices, up to 10 factories paid an average base price for heifers in excess of €3.50/kg. He said clearly this means many farmers were getting a heifer base price well in excess of €3.50/kg.
The IFA livestock leader said with the most recent increase in feed and fertiliser costs, winter finishers will have to get substantial further cattle price increases to recover these additional expenses. He said based on the latest figures the increased costs were the equivalent of up to 20c/kg in beef prices.
On Turkey, Michael Doran said a number of the independent factories had expressed a strong interest in exporting bulls. He said Minister Smith had opened the Turkish market and it was now up to the factories to take advantage of the higher market returns available. He said the spotlight is now firmly on the industry to demonstrate its commitment to maximising market returns in the form of higher producer prices.
On supplies, Michael Doran said Bord Bia are forecasting a reduction in the kill of up to 150,000 cattle for 2011 and a similar reduction in 2012."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4282/,2011-02-23,IFA Launch Profit Plan for the Beef + Livestock Sector,"IFA President John Bryan has launched a Profit Plan for the Beef + Livestock sector this week which identifies €450m in additional profit potential for livestock farmers. The IFA Profit Plan has been submitted to the Food Harvest 2020 Beef Implementation committee, recently established by the Government.
Mr Bryan said “In our Profit Plan, IFA has proposed 54 specific action points and recommendations on beef and livestock for implementation by the Food Harvest Committee which met for the first time this week.”
He said, “Profitability at farm level is essential for the beef and livestock sector to achieve the 20% increase in output value targeted in the Food Harvest 2020 report. It correctly identified the closing of the price differential between Ireland and other premium competitors in the UK and EU as the key challenge facing the beef sector.”
IFA National Livestock Chairman Michael Doran said the main points contained in the IFA Submission include:
Processors must close the unacceptable price gap between Irish and UK/ EU cattle prices on our main export markets in order to return sustainable profit at farm level;
Increased cattle price competition by maximising market access and live export opportunities;
Cattle price contracts at profitable levels for winter finishers and other beef production systems;
Properly rewarding farmers for quality production;
Delivery by An Bord Bia in developing and promoting the Brand Ireland concept to achieve pride of place on supermarket shelves and a premium price for Irish beef;
A strong Government beef and livestock policy which will secure the future of direct payments including the Single Farm Payment in CAP 2013, Disadvantaged Areas, REPS, AEOS and the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme;
Strongly defending the Irish beef sector in the Mercosur negotiations and on EU import standards;
Maintaining and growing the National asset that is our one million head beef suckler cow herd;
An effective Teagasc programme and ICBF beef breeding strategy to deliver improved technical efficiency and productivity at farm level;
Reducing excessive regulation, bureaucracy and costs on production.
The IFA President said beef and livestock is Ireland’s largest farming sector with an output value close to €2bn and employing 150,000 people. It includes beef exports of 500,000t and live cattle exports of over 300,000 head. “Given the importance of the beef and livestock sector to the Irish economy, profit and growth at farm level are essential to Ireland’s economic recovery, maintaining jobs and exports.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4345/,2011-03-08,IFA Presents Beef Proposals to 2020 Implementation Committee,"IFA President John Bryan and National Livestock Chairman Michael Doran have presented details of the IFA Profit Plan for the Beef + Livestock sector to Mr. Michael Dowling, chairman of the Food Harvest 2020 Implementation Committee for beef.
In a meeting in the Irish Farm Centre, John Bryan said profitability at farm level is essential for the beef and livestock sector to achieve the 20% increase in output value targeted in the Food Harvest 2020 report. He said the 2020 report has correctly identified the closing of the price differential between Ireland and other premium competitors in the UK and EU markets as the key challenge facing the beef sector.
The IFA President said we went through the details of the 54 specific action points and recommendations proposed by IFA for implementation by the Food Harvest Committee. He said the IFA plan has identified €450m in additional profit potential for livestock farmers.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Michael Doran said the main points discussed with Michael Dowling and contained in the IFA Submission include;
Processors must close the unacceptable price gap between Irish and UK/ EU cattle prices on our main export markets in order to return sustainable profit at farm level.

The IFA Livestock Chairman said beef and livestock is Ireland’s largest farming sector with an output value close to €2bn, including beef exports of 500,000t and live cattle exports of over 300,000 head. He said the sector employs over 150,000 people including farmers. “Given the importance of the beef and livestock sector to the Irish economy, profit and growth at farm level are essential to Ireland’s economic recovery, maintaining jobs and exports.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4342/,2011-03-10,Factories Must Increase Cattle Prices – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said beef factories and retailers must increase cattle prices to reflect the significant increase in the costs of beef production this spring.
Michael Doran said Teagasc has calculated that production costs are up 11% driven by higher feed, fertiliser and fuel costs. This is equivalent to an additional cost of 32c/kg and prices must increase to cover this.
Michael Doran said beef prices have been stuck in a vice since the New Year and with costs rocketing, prices must now rise to take winter finishers out of a loss making situation.
Michael Doran said there was significant potential in the market for prices to increase with Bord Bia reporting prices in the UK at the equivalent of €3.48/kg for R grade steers. He said R grade young bulls in France are making the equivalent of €3.57/kg, €3.82/kg in Germany and €4.00/kg in Italy.
Michael Doran said IFA is working with Bord Bia on a new steak promotional campaign for the domestic market for the end of March.
On prices, the IFA man said factories are paying up to €3.36/kg base price for steers, €3.40 to €3.50/kg base prices for heifers and bulls. He said cows are making from €2.94 to €3.10/kg. “The big factory groups are trying to halt the base price at €3.30/kg but farmers are digging in and getting up to €3.36/kg for steers and €3.50/kg for heifers and bulls.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4360/,2011-03-16,Beef Factory Prices Must Rise – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said beef prices at the factories must rise in order to lift winter finishers out of the current loss making situation as a result of higher costs.
Michael Doran said production costs are up dramatically this year with Teagasc calculating the increase at the equivalent of 32c/kg on beef farms. He said feed, fertiliser and fuel costs have rocketed and both factories and retailers must take account of these increases.
On the market side, Michael Doran said the price differential with the average cattle price in our main markets is 29c/kg or over €100 per head. He said R3 grade male cattle prices in the UK are the equivalent of €3.49/kg. In France, R3 cattle prices are €3.56/kg, €3.62/kg in Spain and €3.77/kg in Germany. In our top paying market in Italy, R3 male animals are making €3.92/kg.
In addition, Michael Doran said the factory returns from the increase in the value of the fifth quarter has also increased substantially with high prices making up to €50 per head, which is the equivalent of 14c/kg.
Michael Doran said there is plenty of scope in the market place and in factory returns to provide a substantial increase in cattle prices, in order to cover the higher costs of production"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4378/,2011-03-23,IFA Says Beef Prices Are Starting to Rise,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said that cattle prices have started to move and feeders should now dig in and insist on an immediate and substantial price increase across the board.
Michael Doran said supplies have tightened considerably this week and agents and factories are now chasing cattle. He said €3.40/kg base price is now being paid for steers and €3.42/kg to €3.50/kg is being paid for bulls and heifers.
Michael Doran said with a significant dry up in the numbers, feeders are in a much stronger position with the factories. He said it is expected that numbers will continue to tighten over the next number of weeks. “The latest CMMS data for December 1st 2010 shows that there are 320,000 less cattle in the country. In the male 18 to 24 age category, numbers are down by over 95,000 head alone.”
On the market side, Michael Doran said there has been a substantial lift in steak prices over the last 10 days. “In the UK, the penny is beginning to drop that supplies are going to be extremely tight and prices are rising.” In addition, Michael Doran said there is no longer a cheap supply source from South America as their prices are at EU levels.
In terms of processor returns Michael Doran said there is major scope at factory level for prices to rise. As well as strong beef prices, hides prices have now moved up to €50/head, equivalent to 14c/kg on the carcase. Offals are also highly valuable and worth another €60 to €70/head."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4425/,2011-04-07,Finishers Demand Substantial Beef Price Increase – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said cattle finishers cannot afford to sell cattle and should not part with stock at the low base prices of €3.30/kg to €3.36/kg. Finishers must insist on a minimum base price of €3.42/kg for steers and €3.50/kg for heifers and bulls. He said top base prices of €3.50/kg for steers and €3.60/kg have been paid this week.
Michael Doran said there is a major increase in market demand for Easter and UK prices has forged ahead to the equivalent of €3.60/kg. He said “Feeders must make it clear to the factories that they will not sell at a loss and are demanding the price rises that have already occurred in the market place. Factories cannot be allowed hold back on market price increases any longer”.
The IFA livestock leader said supplies have tightened considerably and factories and agents are chasing cattle. He said base prices of up to €3.50/kg for steers and €3.60/kg for heifers have been paid by some plants to get stock.
On the market side demand has picked up considerably and prices have jumped. UK prices have moved up to £3.00/kg with some plants paying £3.05/kg, equivalent to €3.66/kg. On the Continent R3 males are making €3.88/kg in Italy, €3.83/kg in Germany, €3.57/kg in Spain and €3.52/kg in France.
Michael Doran said factories are now actively killing for Easter and are worried about getting adequate supplies. With 2 bank holidays and the Royal Wedding all within a week, UK retail demand will be exceptionally strong and prices are expected to continue to increase. Against this background, Michael Doran said now is the time for finishers to demand a substantial price increase in order to cover the 32c/kg increase in their costs this year."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4471/,2011-05-05,IFA Says Sellers Market for Beef Cattle,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said cattle prices are contuining to strengthen with factories having the pay €3.60 to €3.70/kg base price for steers and an additional 6c to 10c/kg for heifers and bulls. He said factories have paid €3.80/kg plus for quality heifers and bulls this week.
Mr Doran said it is a sellers market and numbers are extremely tight at the factories coupled with very strong market demand. “ Factories are struggling to get numbers and chasing feeders for stock.”
The IFA Livestock leader said feeders that have shopped around and were prepared to move have received up to 20ckg more than they were originally offered
Michael Doran said feeders must take full advantage of the current positive market and ensure they are getting full value for their stock. He said costs have increased substantially this year and feeders need current prices to make a margin after a long and expensive winter."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4516/,2011-05-31,IFA Says Strong Eu Beef Market and Tight Supplies,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said prime cattle supplies are exceptionally tight and will tighten further over the coming weeks before the supply of grass cattle emerges. He said farmers will strongly resist negative talk from the factories on cattle prices.
Michael Doran said the factories are attempting to pull cull cow prices as supplies peak.
The IFA livestock leader said the average R=3+ reported Department of Agriculture price paid by the factories was €3.72/kg for steers, €3.80/kg heifers and €3.73/kg for bulls.
Michael Doran said the factories were doing very well with the value of hides and the fifth quarter, which were worth over €100/head or 29c/kg. He said this is an exceptionally strong return for the meat plants.
The IFA livestock leader said all across Europe cattle supplies are tight and should remain so. The EU December 2010 census shows total livestock numbers down over 2.7m head or 1.7%. All groups of cattle numbers are down, with young animals less than 1 year down 0.9%, animals between 1 to 2 years of age down 1.8% and animals over 2 years down 1.4%.
Michael Doran said Irish cattle supplies are forecast to be down 120,000 – 140,000 head for 2011 and with the kill back only 5.5% to date, numbers are going to be very scarce for the second half of the year. Likewise, a similar picture is developing for the UK with total cattle supplies forecast to be back over 100,000 head for the second half of the year.
Michael Doran said Europe has responded to the very strong international market for beef with EU exports almost doubled at 485,166t for 2010 compared to only 249,165t for 2009. “Exports to Russia, our largest EU export market were up 167%, while over 70,000t was exported to Turkey and 34,0000t to the Lebanon.”
Michael Doran pointed out the major jump in the value of EU beef exports up from €615m in 2009 to €1.246bn in 2010. Exports to Turkey were worth an average of €3,575/t.
In addition, EU beef imports fell from 437,182t in 2009 to 378,954t in 2010 or 12.5%. Imports from Brazil, have fallen dramatically down from 344,000t in 2007 to 145,000t in 2010."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4661/,2011-08-24,IFA Says Prospects for Autumn Cattle Trade Are Positive,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said the cattle trade remains steady despite negative factory price propaganda. He said with tight supplies and strong export market outlets and prices, the prospects for the autumn cattle trade are positive.
Mr Doran said farmers need to be strong in dismissing the negative price propaganda from the factories and agents. “The key factors that drive the beef trade and strong cattle prices are very positive and this must be returned to farmers.”
Finished cattle supplies, to date this year, are down 36,000 head at the factories and are forecast to be back over 100,000 head by year end;
Currently supplies are running at 30,000 head per week. Based on projected supplies, the average kills between now and year-end will be less than 30,000 per week;
Department of Agriculture AIMS data for April 2011 shows cattle numbers in the 12 to 30 month age categories down 188,000 head compared with 2010;
Live exports in 2010 were very strong, up 20% at 350,000 head;
These combined factors mean cattle supplies at the factories will be very tight for the remainder of 2011;
To date this year, R3 grade steer prices are up 15%, at an average of €3.52/kg;
Cattle prices for R3 steers in the UK, our main export market, are currently at the equivalent to €3.80-€3.85/kg.<span>   UK prices have risen over the last 3 to 4 weeks;</span>
UK cattle supplies were up 9% for the first half of 2011 and are forecast to be tighter by 4% for the second half of the year;
Cattle prices in our main EU markets for R3 males are running at the equivalent of; Italy €3.83/kg, Germany €3.70/kg, France €3.55/kg and Spain €3.54/kg;
International beef prices remain very strong at the equivalent of; €2.98/kg in Uruguay, €2.82/kg in Argentina and €2.74/kg in Brazil. More importantly large supply volumes from these markets are not available;
Demand for Irish beef on international markets is growing with exports to Russia for the first 5 months at 3,322t compared to 334t last year. International enquiries for Irish beef are strong and growing;
The value of the fifth quarter is very strong, worth the equivalent of 25 – 30c/kg. The export value of hides and skins for the first 5 months of this year has increased by 170% compared to 2009 according to CSO data.
Michael Doran said there is no basis for any weakening in cattle prices as we head into the Autumn. He said it is vitally important that negative factory propaganda is dismissed and farmers secure the true and full value for their stock."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4841/,2011-11-24,IFA – Cattle Trade Remains Strong,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said the cattle trade remains strong with factories paying a base price of €4.00/kg for steers and €4.10/kg to €4.15/kg for heifers.
Michael Doran said demand is very strong for the Christmas trade and In spec steers and heifers are commanding premium prices at the factories.
The IFA livestock leader said the beef market prospect going forward remain very positive. He said across the UK and EU markets production is down, exports are up, imports are down and prices are rising. The world beef market has been transformed over the last 12 months with prices in South America, North America, Australia and other major producing countries approaching EU levels of €3.50/€3.80/kg. He said this is a fundamental and unprecedented change in the beef market.
In the UK Michael Doran said production is forecast to be down by 6% next year and prices are continuing to rise at €4.15/kg and up to €4.27/kg in Scotland for R grade steers.
In Ireland, Bord Bia are forecasting supplies to be down by up to 90,000 head for 2012 with prime steer supplies back 70,000 head and heifers down 37,000 head. Michael Doran said this will leave cattle extremely tight at the factories next spring and for 2012. He said factories were still trying to contract cattle for early next year.
The IFA livestock leader pointed out that for the first 8 months of 2011, the EU ran a net beef deficit of 200,000t. He said EU beef exports reached 420,000, compared imports at 214,000t. This is a reflection of the very strong world market for beef. Michael Doran pointed out that EU countries had exported 119,000t to Turkey, 85,000t to Russia and a further 213,000t to other destinations all over the world.
On EU beef imports, Michael Doran said imports from South America had declined significantly with Brazil down to 80,000t from 363,000t in 2007. Imports from Argentina to the end of August are also back at 42,000t compared to 122,000t in 2009."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4862/,2011-12-06,Eu Beef Market Prospects Positive – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Michael Doran said the prospects for the EU beef market are very positive, with prices forecast to stay rising in 2012.
Speaking following an EU Beef Advisory meeting in Brussels, Michael Doran said the EU Commission is forecasting beef prices to continue rising in 2012, driven by lower production and tighter supplies, increasing exports and lower imports. “The Commission is forecasting beef production for the EU to decline by 2.8% to 7,122m tonnes in 2012 and prices to increase by a further 1.7%, on top of a 9.5% price increase in 2011.”
The EU Commission pointed out that the very positive change in beef prices has come about because of the dramatic increase in EU beef exports, up 230,000t so far in 2011 compared with 2009 levels and the fall off in beef imports, down 189,000t to date in 2011 compared to 2009.
This dramatic swing in the European beef market, going from a net importer of 308,000t in 2007 to a net exporter of 237,000t this year, has been driven by a dramatic surge in world beef prices and a fall-off in beef production.
Michael Doran pointed out that the EU Commission statistics show that cattle prices on the world market, as measured by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, were ranging from €1.50 to €2.00/kg for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. Since early 2010, the world beef price has jumped dramatically and continues to rise. For 2010 and 2011 prices in the key South American exporting counties have ranged from €2.50/kg to €3.00/kg. In reality he said prices on the world market have closed a large proportion of the major gap with EU prices.
Cattle stocks in the USA are at record low levels and cattle prices have hit the highest rates ever recorded. The drought and destocking in the major beef production states of Texas and New Mexico are very dramatic and will have a long term impact.
Michael Doran pointed out that the increase in world beef prices has opened up many new opportunities for European beef exports, with a massive increase in exports to Turkey at 131,562t to date this year. He pointed out that total EU beef exports to the end of September this year have reached 478,793t, compared to exports of 249,165t for all of 2009.
On the domestic market, Michael Doran said Bord Bia are forecasting cattle supplies at the factories to be even tighter in 2012 with slaughterings back by up to 90,000 head. Steer supplies are projected to fall by 50,000-70,000 head and heifer supplies are forecast to be back by 27,000-37,000 head. He said this would leave prime cattle supplies extremely tight for 2012.
Michael Doran also pointed out that the Department of Agriculture AIMS data show male animals in the 12 to 30 month age category down by 168,000 head in July 2011.
In the UK, EBLEX are forecasting cattle supplies to fall by 6% in 2012, pointing to a very strong market demand for beef imports.
On consumption, Michael Doran said the 52 week figures to October 2<sup>nd</sup> 2011 show a 2.3% increase in retail prices and a 2.4% volume reduction in Ireland on beef. In the UK, the same figures show a 1.2% price increase and a 0.2% volume increase."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-4966/,2012-02-08,Tight Supplies Stabilise Beef Prices,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said factories are struggling to get finished cattle numbers and are having to pay over the quoted prices. He said strong farmer resistance and tighter supplies have stabilised the trade. “The cold snap in Britain combined with tighter supplies has seen a rise in UK cattle prices this week. “
The IFA livestock leader said steers are making €4.00/kg with some prices of €4.05/kg to get out stock. He said heifers are making €4.10 – €4.15/kg and young bulls are making €4.10 – €4.20/kg."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-4973/,2012-02-13,IFA Welcome New Beef Discussion Group Programme,"IFA President John Bryan today (Mon) welcomed the launch of the new Beef Discussion Group programme by the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney.
Speaking at the Teagasc suckler cow event in Kilkenny mart, John Bryan said IFA worked hard to secure €5m funding for Beef Discussion Groups and this is a very positive initiative for the beef and livestock sector.
The IFA President said the Beef Discussion Group programme presents a major opportunity for Teagasc to deliver real results for the livestock sector at individual farm level. “The Discussion Group concept is well proven in dairying and this new programme provides a real opportunity for Teagasc to deliver to beef and livestock farmers.”
John Bryan said improving output, technical efficiency and profitability at farm level are key objectives set out in the Food Harvest 2020 Plan for the beef sector. He said participation in a Discussion Group will help encourage and drive farmers in a team approach in achieving these targets and securing strong growth in the beef sector.
The IFA President said increasing profitability at farm level is the major challenge for the livestock sector. He said, “As well as output, efficiency and costs, there is a major responsibility on the processing sector to maintain strong viable cattle prices in order to deliver increased farm profit. In addition, it is essential the Minister for Agriculture protects national funding for all the farm schemes and secures a strong outcome to the CAP 2013 negotiations.” He pointed out that Direct Payments make up a much higher proportion of income on beef and livestock farms.
John Bryan said costs at farm level associated with the Discussion Group programme must be kept to a minimum. He said up to 5,000 beef and suckler farmers should receive €1,000 per annum for participating in the programme, which will involve attending up to 6 discussion group meetings and a number of other tasks.
Encouraging beef and suckler farmers to apply for the scheme by the closing date of March 7th, John Bryan said farmers needed to get their application forms completed and back to Teagasc or their independent facilitator without delay."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5008/,2012-02-29,Factories Paying 5 – 10c/kg over Quoted Prices for Beef – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said factories have to pay 5c to 10c/kg over quoted prices to get adequate numbers of cattle this week. He said supplies are extremely tight and farmers should dig in and bargain hard with the factory to maximise the price.
Henry Burns said the kill at just over 26,000 per week is very tight. Steer supplies are exceptionally tight running at slightly over half of the 2010 levels. The overall kill is down 8,000 per week compared to 2010 and 4,000 per week less than 2011 levels.
The IFA livestock leader said the increase in prices in the UK and Northern Ireland is a reflection of tight supplies. He added, “Demand will be strong in the coming weeks with Easter on April 8th, which is only 5 weeks away. This will be followed by the European Football Championships which kicks off in early June and runs into July. The London Olympics will be a massive €2bn event and commences on July 27th and runs until August 12th.”
On prices, Henry Burns said steers are making a base of €4.00 to €4.05/kg, heifers €4.10 – €4.15/kg and bulls are ranging from €4.00 – €4.10/kg for R grades and €4.10 – €4.15/kg for U grades. Cow prices have also improved ranging from €3.40/kg to €3.80/kg and there is a very good demand for heifers to go North with flat prices of €4.25/kg for R + U grades."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5043/,2012-03-14,IFA – Feeders Digging in for Beef Price Increase,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said feeders are digging in for a beef price increase to cover the increased costs on feed, fuel and fertiliser. He said feed has gone up again in the last week and cattle in sheds since last autumn have encountered major costs at this stage.
Henry burns said with the kill down below 25,000 head, feeders that are prepared to dig in hard and move factory if necessary, are getting 5c to 10c above quoted prices.
The IFA livestock leader said farmers should not be afraid of moving factories to get a price lift. Some factories are offering top up cheques on the base price to hold customers and give the impression prices are not rising.
Henry Burns said steers are making €4.05/kg with some tops of €4.10/kg being paid. Heifers are making up to €4.15/kg again with some top prices of €4.20/kg being paid. Bulls are the trickiest with prices ranging from €4.00 to €4.10/kg for R grades and €4.10 to €4.20/kg for U grades. He said R/U grade bulls re making €4.15 flat. Cows are ranging from €3.60 to €3.90/kg with a few top prices of €4.00/kg for real quality cows."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-5117/,2012-04-26,IFA – Strong Eu Forecast for Beef Market,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said having fed cattle for 4 to 6 months at this stage and incurred several increases in the costs of feed, fuel and fertiliser, winter finishers are not going to part with cattle easy at this time. He said finishers digging in on price are getting 5c – 10c/kg over the going rates.
Henry Burns said steers and heifers are very scarce with a base price of €4.10/kg for steers and €4.20/kg for heifers and up to €4.25/kg being paid to get numbers. He said bulls are making €4.10/€4.20/kg for R/U grades. Cow prices have increased this week reflecting the very strong manufacturing trade, with quality R grade cows making in excess of €4.00/kg.
The IFA livestock leader said following a meeting of the EU Beef Advisory Committee in Brussels last week, the EU Commission are forecasting a positive beef trade for 2012 with prices predicated to increase by 6% this year."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-5163/,2012-05-24,Restrictive Bull Beef Weight Limit Will Hit Profitability and Increase Live Trade,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said the move by some meat factories to impose restrictive weight limits on bull beef production will seriously damage profitability and limit returns to farmers.
He said in practice a 380kg weight limit will not work as it removes the profitable grass based weight gain from bull beef and in turn leaves the system unviable. The reality is more of the quality weanlings bulls will head down the live export route as the factory weight limit takes away the ability of the Irish feeder to compete with his Italian counterpart.
Henry Burns said many bull beef feeders were in contact with the IFA over the last week complaining about what they describe as “a negative move to limit beef and weanling prices”.
The IFA Livestock leader said it would be a real wrong move by factories to try and force the removal of the grass based feeding period out of bull beef production. He said instead of trying to force cattle into higher cost indoor grain based feeding systems with unviable weight limits, processors should be using outdoor grass based feeding as our real point of difference in the market to secure a premium price.
Henry Burns said the reality of bull beef production is because of the high costs of indoor feeding, particularly over the last 120 days to get the necessary finish, there is very limited profit without a 6 or 7 month grazing period. The costs difference between expensive indoor feeding and grass could be as much as €3 per head per day, which would hit the enterprise by up to €500."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5208/,2012-06-27,Strong Cattle Prices Essential for Growth in Beef Sector – IFA,"Speaking at the Teagasc beef open day in Grange, Co. Meath, IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said to sustain the positive growth in the beef and livestock sector strong viable cattle prices are absolutely essential going forward. He said with the continuing increase in production costs and cuts to vital farm schemes, livestock farmers are dependent on a strong price return from the market to maintain and grow production.
On the Ciolos CAP 2013 reforms, Henry Burns said Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney must maintain a tough bargaining position for Ireland and ensure full funding of the Single Farm Payment and Rural Development is secured. He said the Single Farm Payment must be fully protected with strong opposition to flattening and regionalisation. “Payments must support active farmers and underpin production.”
Henry Burns said there can be no more cuts to farm schemes and Minister Coveney would have to look elsewhere for savings. He said the maintenance of the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme is vital to suckler farmers going forward and particularly the beef sectors ability to service and grow high quality retail market outlets in line with the Food Harvest 2020 targets.
The IFA livestock leader said the ongoing political and diplomatic initiatives of Minister Coveney on re-opening beef and live export markets is very important for the livestock sector.  He said the sector is anticipating progress on the opening of the beef market to the USA on the back of the Minister’s visit this week. In addition, Henry Burns said with the increase in the number of younger stock, particularly from the dairy herd, it was never more important for Minister Coveney to secure the re-opening of the live cattle trade to the Middle East and North Africa"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-5235/,2012-07-13,IFA Accuse Factories of Using Bad Weather to Undermine Beef Trade,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns strongly criticised the factories this week of taking advantage of the difficult weather conditions to pull beef prices. He accused the factories of talking down prices and undermining confidence in the trade.
Henry Burns said the facts are prices in our main export market in the UK remain very strong at the equivalent of over €4.50/kg. In addition, the exchange rate has improved in the last week and demand remains strong.
Henry Burns said despite scare tactics being put out by the factories on their inability to sell beef, cattle supplies remain very tight, there is not a kilo of beef in store and retail prices in the UK are up 5.9%, with purchases up 0.1% for the 52 week period to mid May 2012.
The IFA livestock leader said farmers are very concerned at the intent which factories are trying to undermine the cattle trade. “Last week factory bosses were linking increased numbers to a major price cut. This week factories decided to try and hit the price on the back of bad weather.”
Henry Burns said with all the negative signals from the factories, the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must redouble his efforts to re-open the live export trade to the Middle East and North Africa.
The IFA livestock leader said “with the factories setting out their stall on cattle prices, farmers expect Minister Coveney to provide the necessary competition from the live export trade.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5244/,2012-07-18,IFA Accuse Factories of Attacking Cattle Prices,"IFA President John Bryan said the meat factories were attacking cattle prices in an unjustified and opportunistic manner. He said the factories were guilty of compounding the bad weather problems and deliberately spreading misinformation by telling farmer suppliers they were full of stock when the facts show the weekly kill was the lowest for the year at just 23,412.
John Bryan said prices in our main export market in the UK are the equivalent of €4.50/kg incl Vat, and sterling has gained 3% against the Euro since the start of July.
The IFA President said the message from the factories to their farmer suppliers was very negative. “The factories are telling farmers they are not able to handle 24,000 cattle per week without cutting the price. This is a very serious and worrying message for the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney and the beef and livestock sector, in the context of the Food Harvest 2020 Plan.”
John Bryan said Minister Coveney needs to secure the recommencement of the live export trade to Libya, Egypt and the Lebanon immediately. He said with an increase in the supply of younger cattle and the price-cutting tactics of the factories, Minister Coveney must re-open the live trade to these markets and secure price competition and alternative market outlets."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5252/,2012-07-23,Farmers Fighting Back Against Factories on Beef Price – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said farmers were fighting back hard against the factories on cattle prices this week. “With the improving weather situation, farmers are very busy and factories are finding it extremely difficult to get cattle. Factories are having to pay 5-10c/kg over quoted prices to get numbers.”
The IFA livestock leader said the factories had used the bad weather situation over the last 3 weeks to attack cattle prices in a most unjustified way. “With the change in the weather, it is going to take a lot more than the quoted price to buy cattle this week.”
Henry Burns said, “Some plants had offered €3.95/kg last Saturday and were told where to go. These same plants were back last Sunday night looking for the cattle, offering €4.05/kg and had to get the stock for early Monday morning. They were also paying €4.15-€4.20 for heifers.”
Henry Burns said the kill at just 23,412 for week ending July 15<sup>th</sup> was the lowest in 3 years and proved the massive misinformation being propagated by the factories that they were full of stock.
The IFA livestock leader said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK remain very strong at the equivalent of €4.49/kg as reported by An Bord Bia. In addition, he said the exchange rate with sterling had improved steadily over the last 3 weeks.
Henry Burns said Minister Coveney needs to react to the negative message from the meat factories on cattle prices and secure the recommencement of the live export trade to Libya, Egypt and the Lebanon without further delay. He said against the price cutting tactics of the factories, Minister Coveney must re-open the live trade for price competition and alternative market outlets."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5272/,2012-07-30,IFA – Farmers Fighting Back Hard Against Factories on Beef Price,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said farmers were fighting back hard against the factories on cattle prices. He said “Farmers are not prepared to take the lower quoted prices and the factories are finding it extremely difficult to get cattle. Factories are having to pay 5-10c/kg over quoted prices to get numbers.”
The IFA livestock leader said the factories had used the bad weather situation over recent weeks to attack cattle prices in a most unjustified way. He said “It is going to take a good bit more than quoted prices to buy cattle next week.”
Henry Burns said “some plants had offered €3.95/kg last week and were told where to go. These same plants were back this week looking for the cattle, offering €4.05/kg and had to get the stock immediately. They were also paying €4.15/kg for heifers.”
Henry Burns said the kill remains very low. Up to July 21st, the steer kill is back over 26% or 73,000 head. The heifer kill is down 17% or 40,000 head and the cow kill is back over 6% or 12,000 head. On a weekly basis the kill is running at 23/25,000 head, the lowest in several years. He said these figures prove the massive misinformation being propagated by the factories that they were full of stock. He pointed out that the prime cattle kill in the UK, our main export market, is also down 8.4% or over 90,000 head.
The IFA livestock leader said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK remain very strong at the equivalent of €4.69/kg as reported by An Bord Bia. In addition, he said the exchange rate with sterling had improved steadily over the last 3 weeks and was now at just over 78p/€, compared to 89p/€ this time last year. Henry Burns said the factories had now opened up a massive price gap between Irish cattle prices and UK cattle prices, despite the fact that we are exporting over half our beef into the UK market.
Henry Burns said Minister Coveney needs to react to the negative message from the meat factories on cattle prices and secure the recommencement of the live export trade to Libya, Egypt and the Lebanon without further delay. He said against the price cutting tactics of the factories, Minister Coveney must re-open the live trade for price competition and alternative market outlets.
The IFA Livestock leader said the Minister has made good progress in advancing vetinerary certificates and the Department were currently pursuing improvements. He said at this stage Minister Coveney needs to initiate high level Government to Government communication to deliver a strong live cattle exports business to North Africa and the Middle East.
He said IFA has spoken to a number of interested exporters, all anxious to do business and it is clear high level Government action is required.
Henry Burns said CSO data to May 2012 shows how input costs have increased substantially on farms. He said since 2010 energy costs have increased by 25%, fertiliser prices have increased by 27% and feedstuffs are gone up by 18%. He said in recent weeks further price increases have taken place, particularly the cost of feed, with beef rations now at €300/t."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5318/,2012-08-23,Cattle Farmers Anger Grows as Price Gap Widens – IFA,"IFA President John Bryan has warned factories bosses of mounting farmer anger at the savage cuts in cattle prices quotes, at a time when supplies are low and prices are much stronger on all our main markets in Northern Ireland, Britain and Europe.
John Bryan said beef producers and IFA livestock representatives would be meeting factory managers this week to highlight their anger. He said the IFA would be holding a special meeting of the Livestock Committee and Executive Council early next week to decide on the course of action farmers will take to defend their livelihoods in what is one of the worst summers for weather and cattle performance.
Mr Bryan called on the factory bosses to address immediately the market discrepancies in cattle price quotes. He said with cattle kill numbers at historically low levels, farmers should sell hard and strongly resist attempts by factories to pull prices so far below those operating in our main markets.
IFA Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has rounded on the factories for dropping quotes this week below €3.90/kg. He said, “At a time of rising input costs on farms and atrocious weather, farmers are furious with the factories for blatant profiteering when markets are firmer and cattle are still scarce.”
Henry Burns pointed out that cattle price trends in Britain and our main continental European markets have risen in recent weeks, with tight supplies of finished cattle all across Europe.
“Instead of paying a realistic price, the factories have taken advantage of the weaker euro to line their own pockets. The result is there is an unprecedented gap opening with the UK, with VAT inclusive equivalent prices of €4.25/kg in the North and up to €4.60/kg in Britain. Meanwhile, all our main continental markets are running well in excess of €4/kg.”
Henry Burns also challenged the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney to move immediately to secure live exports to markets such as Libya."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5339/,2012-09-07,IFA Meet Beef Factories and Demand a Price Increase,"At a meeting in Dublin earlier this week, IFA President, John Bryan, left the meat factories in no doubt about the anger among cattle farmers at the way beef prices were cut over recent weeks and the need for a price increase.
With the change in the weather, John Bryan said factories are finding it extremely difficult to get cattle this week and are having to pay higher prices. He said farmers are very busy on the ground and are not prepared to part with stock at quoted prices.
A number of factories have increased their kill days and also increased the price up to €3.90/kg base to get steers. Heifer prices are also rising because of very tight supplies and some plants have paid a base of €4.10/kg this week and flat prices of €4.20/kg have been paid.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the factories had no argument with the Bord Bia market prices put forward by IFA to show that Irish cattle prices can increase. He said the facts speak for themselves and Irish prices can rise based on UK prices of €4.50-€4.60/kg and EU prices of over €4.00/kg and rising.
Henry Burns said supplies have tightened rapidly as this week has progressed. Agents are desperately looking for stock for later in the week and buying and killing cattle on the same day. He said the factories are no longer able to buy cattle at the quoted prices and farmers who are digging in are getting 5-10c/kg more.
Henry Burns said with the change in the weather, the factory kill at 28,000 per week, strong demand, UK and EU prices rising, factories increasing their kill days and a firmer tone to the mart trade, farmers are in a strong position to insist on a beef price increase, which reflects the true market returns."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5375/,2012-10-03,IFA Warn Factories and Retailers of Farmer Anger over Beef Price Cuts,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the negative tactics of the factories this week on cattle prices are seriously eroding confidence and trust with farmers. He said the factories’ drive to cut prices and grab extra profit against improving market returns and low kills of just over 30,000 head were scaring the daylights out of finishers away from feeding cattle this winter as well as undermining important issues like quality assurance.
Henry Burns said at a time when Bord Bia are reporting UK cattle prices at €4.65/kg+ and prices on the main European market at €4.10/4.30/kg+ and rising, the factories have no justification for their price cuts. He said “this week’s attack on cattle prices is a clear case of profiteering by the factories and inflicting further losses on summer grazers, after one of the most difficult seasons on record”.
He called on the factories and the retailers to reflect prices in the marketplace to restore confidence. The IFA Livestock leader warned the factories over their price cutting tactics and said IFA has been in contact with some of the major customers of Irish beef including Tesco, McDonalds and SuperValu highlighting the farmer frustration and anger with the factories. He said these buyers cannot exonerate themselves and must move to ensure that farmers are paid a return in line with current prices.
Henry Burns said a large number of feeders had spoken to IFA at the Ploughing and expressed the strong view that they could not feed cattle this winter with this type of carry-on from the factories and without a strong price contract. “Factories are scaring finishers away from feeding this winter. Committed finishers are saying, if the factories are savaging the price when the kill is only 30,000 head and EU/UK prices are €200/300 per head above Irish prices, what will they do next spring?”
The IFA livestock leader said despite lower quotes this week, factories are paying €3.85/kg base to get steers and €3.95/kg for heifers. “Despite the propaganda from the factories, finished cattle numbers remain tight. The factories stand accused of totally misleading their farmer suppliers on numbers.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5387/,2012-10-15,IFA Says Grass Cattle Drying Up and Feeders Need Price Increase,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said grass cattle are drying up quickly and beef demand is increasing. He said farmers who are now mainly selling out of sheds are not under weather pressure to sell and will need significantly higher prices to move cattle.
Henry Burns said based on market returns there is major scope for cattle prices to increase significantly. He said the market facts as confirmed by An Bord Bia show that cattle prices in our main market in the UK are the equivalent of €4.60/kg+ and prices in our main EU export markets are €4.10 to €4.30/kg.
On supplies, the IFA livestock leader said weekly kills are very tight running 3,000 to 5,000 head per week below last years’ levels. “To date this year the kill is down 14% or 170,000 head. All of the projections indicate that supplies will remain very tight for the remainder of this year and into next year.”
Henry Burns said the Irish beef price is crying out for price competition and he again called on the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney to take immediate action to get the live export trade to the Middle East and North Africa moving.
The IFA livestock leader said several EU countries such as France and Spain are actively exporting cattle to Libya, the Lebanon and other countries. He said since August this year, the factories have taken full advantage of the fact that Irish farmers are being denied price competition from the live export trade.
Henry Burns said Spanish colleagues told him this week that they are currently exporting thousands of Friesian cattle in the 400 to 500kg weight range at prices of €2.10/kg to €2.20/kg to Libya."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5419/,2012-11-07,IFA Says Cattle Prices Rising Strongly,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said cattle prices are rising rapidly as farmers dig in and demand price increases in line with the real market returns. He said farmers are not selling at the low quoted prices from the factories this week, supplies have tightened dramatically and prices have started to rise.
Henry Burns said buying for the important Christmas trade has already kicked in. Factories know supplies will be very tight over the next few weeks and are scrambling for cattle. The strongest price increases have come for heifers with plants paying from €4.10 to €4.40/kg for quality. Flat prices of €4.15/€4.20 for O and R grade heifers were paid this week. Steer prices have also started to rise with some plants offering farmers 10c to 20c/kg over current prices of €3.90/kg base to secure stocks in the coming weeks.
Henry Burns said bull prices are also rising with flat prices of €4.10/kg paid. The base has moved up 10c/kg and is rising fast. U grade bulls are making 6 to 10c/kg more in places.
A good indicator of the change in the trade is the improvement in the cow price. Top quality cows are making €3.60/3.90.
Henry Burns said the beef trade in the UK, our largest market, remains exceptionally strong with Bord Bia reporting R grade steer prices at the equivalent of €4.68/kg or €295 per head over Irish prices. He said the sheer strength of the British market and the large price gap with Irish prices show the massive potential for our cattle prices to continue rising. He added prime cattle supplies in the UK will remain exceptionally scarce with supermarkets and factories reliant on Irish supplies to meet demand. Sterling remains strong against the Euro adding up to30c/kg at current prices additional return compared to this time last year.
European markets are also very strong with R grade male cattle in Germany making €4.37/kg incl. 5.2% Vat and €4.21/kg in Italy, two of our important export markets. In France R grade males are making €4.18/kg.
Henry Burns said the resumption of the Live export trade to the Middle East and North Africa is essential to get some real price competition into the beef price and to secure an alternative market outlet. He said Minister Coveney has pledged to have the trade moving again in the next number of weeks, before Christmas and this is vital for the livestock sector.
The IFA Livestock leader said with feed cost rocketing this year, cattle prices need to rise substantially and stay rising into next year to provide a margin to winter finishers. He said Teagasc have calculated that cattle prices would need to increase to between €4.50 and €4.70/kg to give a return on winter finishing. These prices are in line with the current prices in our main market in the UK."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5456/,2012-11-29,IFA Highlights Price Cost Squeeze on Beef Sector in Brussels,"Speaking from Brussels IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said the losses being encountered from the price cost squeeze in the beef sector were not sustainable for winter finishers and must be urgently addressed by the processing sector. This week Henry Burns represented Irish livestock farmers at the COPA Beef Working Group and the EU Commission Beef Advisory Group in Brussels.
Henry Burns said the massive increase in feed costs this year was inflicting heavy losses on all cattle coming out of sheds.
The IFA livestock leader said based on market returns Irish factories could increase beef prices substantially and close some of the unprecedented gap with UK prices and to a lesser extent EU prices.
Henry Burns said by holding back on market returns and cattle prices factories are seriously damaging winter finishers and in turn the Food Harvest 2020 plan for the beef and livestock sector. He said “the factories are choking off all year round beef supply and driving producers towards more seasonality”.
On the CAP 2013 negotiations, the IFA livestock leader said the Ciolos proposals are totally unacceptable and extremely damaging for the beef and livestock sector. He said “under no circumstances can Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney agree to anything close to what Commissioner Ciolos is proposing on flattening, regionalisation and greening”."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-5476/,2012-12-14,IFA Raise Concerns with Taoiseach over Damage to Ireland’s €2bn Beef Sector from Eu/canadian Trade Talks,"The IFA President John Bryan has written to the Taoiseach Enda Kenny highlighting the serious concerns of Irish farmers over increases in the volume of beef imports into Europe from the current EU/Canadian trade negotiations. He said, “The talks are progressing rapidly and involve access for substantial volumes of beef imports, which would seriously damage the European beef market and in turn the important €2bn Irish beef and livestock sector”.
John Bryan called on the Taoiseach to make urgent contact with European President Barroso and impress on him Ireland’s fears about any increase in access for beef imports. The IFA is also requesting that the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney raise this important issue with EU Agriculture Commissioner Ciolos, and the Minister for Enterprise and Trade Richard Bruton with EU Trade Commissioner De Gucht.
“The EU/Canadian trade negotiations are now approaching a critical stage, particularly in relation to the exchange of offers on access volumes on the beef side. It appears the Canadians are seeking access for major volumes of beef to the EU market which, if granted, would seriously damage the European market.”
The IFA President said with increased access, the Canadians will target Europe with ‘high value steak cuts’. Out of the total EU beef market of about 8 million tonnes, high value steak cuts account for only 560,000t. While they make up a relatively small part of the volume of the overall carcase, they can account for up to 40% of the value. “Therefore, any increase in the volume of steak imports would have a disproportionately negative impact on European beef and cattle prices. This in turn would impact negatively on cattle prices, farm incomes, production, output, exports and jobs in the Irish beef and livestock sector, which is 90% export orientated.”
John Bryan said any analysis of increased beef imports into the EU point to very negative economic, environmental and social consequences across rural communities in Ireland and other parts of Europe which depend on livestock production for their livelihoods. In addition, he pointed out that thousands of tonnes of beef imports into the EU fail to meet European standards on critical issues such as individual identification and registration, environmental, animal health and welfare standards. The Canadians have very real problems with all of these important standard issues."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5521/,2013-01-24,No Basis for Any Attempt to Destabilise Cattle Prices – IFA,"IFA President John Bryan said there would be a very angry response on the ground if meat processors made any attempt to use the events of the last week against farmers on cattle prices. He said, “The market is stable and despite some negative talk among agents, there is no basis whatsoever for any pressure on cattle prices”.
John Bryan said some factory agents were attempting to instil uncertainty into the price situation and this was totally unacceptable. “IFA has been in contact with the major factory groups and has told them in no uncertain terms that any move to destabilise prices on the back of the current situation would meet with strong resistance from farmers. Factories must act responsibly and farmers cannot be penalised over what has happened in the last week.”
He said the base price for steers was €4.15 and €4.30 for heifers, with up to €4.35 paid at the week-end.
John Bryan, who attended Green Week in Berlin last week, said the equine DNA testing was not an issue across our important continental European markets. He said, “The equine DNA issue did not feature among the thousands of delegates attending this major international food event”.
John Bryan said, “Green Week, as the world’s largest food fair, is a good barometer of consumer sentiment. Based on the discussions at the formal and informal sessions, there is scope for Ireland to grow our existing markets for quality beef. The German market, for example, imports 17,000 tonnes of Irish beef and buyers are looking to increase this. In other countries where we export Irish beef, the level of coverage of the fall-out from the FSAI survey findings on Tuesday has not been significant”.
On the Department tests, John Bryan said it is critically important that we have a definitive conclusion as soon as possible to maintain the high reputation of Irish food production, and to re-assure consumers and retailers here and in the UK. “It is essential that the Department of Agriculture quickly identify the precise source of the equine DNA, and who is responsible for this product ending up in Irish burgers.”
He said “Farmers undertake a comprehensive system of cattle identification and traceability at farm level, comprising four key elements. These include double tagging at birth, issuing of an individual passport by the Department of Agriculture, completing the on-farm herd register and recording all movements on a computerised database”."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5638/,2013-04-03,Strong Beef Prices to Continue – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said strong beef prices will continue, driven by tight supplies and very buoyant demand in the market. He said the higher prices are required and farmers will struggle to cover the exceptional high feed costs this spring.
Henry Burns said beef consumption figures for both the UK and our own domestic market are very positive. In addition with the latest EU beef forecast predicting lower production in major countries like France and Italy, the beef trade should remain positive.
The IFA Livestock leader said the base price for steers had moved up to €4.35/4.40 and for heifers €4.50/4.60. He said bulls are making €4.35/kg and cow prices had also improved. Henry Burns said the increase in the In-spec payment bonus at the beef factories from 6c/kg to 12c/kg under the Quality Payment System is a positive move and reflective of market change. Flat prices of €4.70/4.80/kg have been paid for Angus and Hereford heifers, which are in very strong demand.
Henry Burns said with better rewards for In spec stock, farmers will respond to quality assurance and other In-spec issues. He made it clear that there is no weight restrictions involved under the QPS.IFA is working hard to get more farmers into the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme. Henry Burns strongly criticised some factories for attempting to impose excessive penalties on non-quality stock or out of spec stock. He said this negative approach was damaging the positive work to increase participation.
The IFA livestock leader said the factories need to go a step further and reward all stock from quality assured farms. He said discriminating against some stock works against the Quality Assurance Scheme at farm level. In addition, Henry Burns said the factories need to show flexibility to accommodate the sale of finished stock through the livestock marts.
On live exports, Henry Burns said the news is also positive with another major exporter actively buying Continental and Friesian cross bulls for another boat to sail to Libya in mid-April. Weights are in the range of 300kg to 430kg. “This is positive following on from the successful shipment of 2,850 cattle to Libya in February.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5798/,2013-07-04,IFA Accuse Factories of Limiting Beef Kill to Artificially Back Up Supplies and Pull Prices,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said with the beef price in our main export market in the UK at €5.00/kg, the actions of the meat plants in pulling cattle prices is totally unjustified. He said the facts are there is a massive shortage of beef in the UK and demand remains very strong.
Henry Burns said the latest Bord Bia report states that the UK trade remains unchanged as favourable weather conditions continues to help the trade and demand for steak cuts remains firm. On the Continent, Bord Bia reports that the beef trade remained firm across most markets and continues to be helped by on-going tight supplies across the different key export markets. Strong demand is evident for hindquarter product, with best trade for fillets and striploins.
Henry Burns said in the Food Harvest 2020 plan, factories claimed they wanted to increase beef production and they claimed they could easily sell 40,000 cattle per week. He said this week procurement managers and agents are telling farmers they are full up of cattle, although the kill is only 28,000 head. He said the reality is the factories are limiting the kill and backing up numbers in order to pull back prices.
The IFA Livestock leader said it is very clear from the lack of competition in the trade in the last two weeks, Minister Coveney needs to take immediate action on cattle prices and get more boats cleared for more live exports. He said, “Good progress has been made in reopening the Libyan market and we now need more boats and more exports. Another boat sailed last week to Libya with 1,500 bulls and up to 5,000 sheep”.
Henry Burns said IFA is working hard to increase the live trade to the UK and open up more competition in the beef trade. He said, “Ireland has the best beef and cattle trade in the world on our doorstep in the UK market and we need to maximise the full potential of this market which is currently paying over €5.00/kg for cattle”."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5800/,2013-07-08,With Fine Weather and Tight Supplies Farmers Reject Factory Beef Price Cuts – IFA,"With the farmers very busy at silage and hay and little or no pressure to move cattle, IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said farmers selling cattle should demand last week’s price and reject any price cuts from the factories.  “Despite the propaganda from the factories, the supply situation is very tight, demand is very strong and farmers should not part with cattle easily.”
The IFA livestock leader said with the beef price in our main export market in the UK very strong at €5.00/kg, the actions of the meat plants in pulling cattle prices is totally unjustified. He said the facts are there is a massive shortage of beef in the UK and demand remains very strong. Henry Burns said the factories would be much better employed in trying to maximise this opportunity as opposed to inflicting heavy price cuts on farmers.
Henry Burns said the current price cutting by the factories was seriously eroding confidence in the beef sector following one of the most difficult springs on record with the fodder crisis and farmers left with major bills to pay.
Henry Burns said in the Food Harvest 2020 plan, factories claimed they wanted to increase beef production and they claimed they could easily sell 40,000 cattle per week.

He said “Ireland has the best beef and cattle trade in the world on our doorstep in the UK market and we need to maximise the full potential of this market which is paying €5.00/kg for cattle.”
On prices, Henry Burns said the base price for steers is €4.35/kg with some factories quoting €4.30/kg.  The base for Heifers is €4.55/kg, again with some factories quoting €4.50/kg.  Bulls are making €4.20/4.30/kg with some prices of €4.35/kg paid.  Cows are ranging from €3.20 to €3.90/kg."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5848/,2013-08-07,Cattle Prices Stabilise – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said cattle prices have stabilised this week with solid demand for steers and heifers and  factories finding it much more difficult to get cattle. He said the base price for steers is €4.10 to €4.20/kg and €4.20 to €4.30/kg for heifers. He said farmers who are bargaining hard and resisting the lower quoted prices are getting the higher end prices.
The IFA Livestock leader said cattle and beef price stability is essential to stabilise the fragile suckler sector and halt the exodus in suckler cows. He said the Taoiseach Enda Kenny is very strong in his support for sucklers and it is essential this was not undermined in any way.
Henry Burns said prices in our main export market in the UK remain solid at the equivalent of €4.90/kg or a full 70c/kg or €250 per head over Irish prices. He said this level of price differential with our main export market cannot be justified by the factories. Bord Bia report the GB price at £4.06/kg which is equivalent to €4.92/kg.
The IFA Livestock leader said there is evidence that the European market is strengthen with Bord Bia reporting the trade being helped by on-going tight supplies across the key export markets.
Henry Burns said the combination of significantly cheaper feed costs this year and a settling of the EU beef price should help lift the live trade for weanlings and stores for the second half of the year. He said to date this year live exports are up 74% at 142,842 head. The big increases have come in calves exports, up over 50,000 head on last year with large increases to the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and France.
Weaning exports to Italy are back at 13,560 head but are expected to rise for the Autumn. The store trade to Northern Ireland is also back as a result of the strength of sterling and changes following the horsemeat scandal. However to date this year 21,317 cattle have gone North and a further 5,719 cattle have gone across the water to Great Britain.
Henry Burns said IFA is continuing to work hard on opening up the live trade to the UK with recent positive meetings with ferry companies, exporters and UK buyers. He said with the UK beef price at the equivalent of €4.90/kg, there is massive demand and huge potential for the live trade to the UK.
Henry Burns said IFA work in reopening the Libyan market was paying dividends with 7,424 cattle and almost 15,000 lambs shipped to date this year. Exports to Tunisia have also being active with 2,322 cattle shipped to date this year. Henry Burns said IFA were continuing to work hard to attract more exporters and get more ships cleared for export. He said the Department had cleared a number of ships and more applications are being actively considered. The IFA Livestock leader said the current pull on cattle prices by the factories was a clear message to Minister Coveney that there was an urgent need for more competition, more ships and more live exports."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/news-article-5842/,2013-08-07,IFA and Ufu Work on Cattle and Sheep Agenda,"An IFA/UFU livestock meeting in Dublin called on the meat factories both sides of the border to immediately halt the slide in beef prices and stabilise the trade. IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said farmers in Northern Ireland and the Republic remain frustrated that prices continue to lag significantly behind those in Great Britain and factories simply cannot justify the massive price gap in the order of €250 per head that they have opened up with our most important market.
On lamb prices IFA National Sheep Chairman James Murphy said the lamb trade both North and South has stabilised at prices of €4.90 to €5.00/kg. He said supplies are tight as a result of weaning and compliance with fly strike controls.
James Murphy said it is essential there is no soft selling of lamb and farmers should fully finish their lambs to maximise returns. He said more of the forecasts for the second half of the year are pointing to tighter supplies in Ireland and across the UK. In addition the latest figures emerging from New Zealand are predicting numbers to be back several millions as a result of the severe drought earlier this year.
On lamb sales and consumption, James Murphy said it is vitally important retailers continue to positively push lamb sales and Bord Bia and the LMC continue to strongly promote lamb.
On implementation of the recent CAP Reform, the IFA/UFU meeting agreed that there must be strong targeted support for the livestock sector geared at suckler cows and breeding ewes. IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the real issue is about maintain our suckler cow herd and national ewe flock, together with the associated €6bn in economic output, exports and jobs that they deliver to the national economy. He said coupling is only part of this debate. The bigger picture is maintaining the largest and most important farming sector on the island.
Henry Burns pointed out that a recent study on the livestock sector commissioned by IFA and undertaken by Agricultural Economics Professor Alan Renwick from University College Dublin clearly shows every €1 invested in direct payments in livestock delivers a return of €4 in economic output in the wider economy. “There is an irrefutable case for investing strong pillar 1, pillar 2 and national funding in targeted payments for suckler cows and ewes.”
The Livestock delegation from the Irish Farmers Association included National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns, National Sheep Chairman James Murphy and Kevin Kinsella Director of Livestock. The Ulster Farmers Union delegation included Robert Davidson  UFU Beef and Lamb Chairman, Crosby Cleland UFU Beef and Lamb Committee and Gill Gallagher UFU policy officer."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/news-article-5841/,2013-08-07,Stable Beef Prices and Strong Live Exports Vital for Store and Weanling Trade,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said stable beef prices and strong live exports are vital for the store and weanling trade as we head into the Autumn. He said the critical issue is that beef prices stabilise so as feeders have the confidence to buy cattle and feed.
“Feeders will be slow if the see factories continuing to pull back prices. The excessive and unjustified price cuts of recent weeks seriously damages confidence in the sector. Feeders need certainty and stability from the factories on prices.”
Henry Burns said the store and weaning price has taken a big hit from last year which is a major problem for the incomes of hard pressed suckler farmers. He said the lift in prices in the last week was encouraging and badly needed. “With a good burst in grass growth, demand will lift  the trade. “
Henry Burns said the combination of significantly cheaper feed costs this year and a settling of the EU beef price should help lift the live trade for weanlings and stores for the second half of the year.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/strong-demand-for-christmas-beef-trade-drives-up-prices-ifa/,2013-10-30,Strong Demand for Christmas Beef Trade Drives Up Prices – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said there is very strong demand for the Christmas beef trade, especially from our main export market in the UK where prices remain very buoyant at the equivalent of €4.94/kg for R grade steers.
Henry Burns said factories are in full production for Christmas at this stage and the strong demand from the UK is driving the trade. He said procurement managers and agents are very active for stock and farmers need to ensure they are maximising the value of their finished cattle.” Farmers bargaining hard are negotiating prices of 5c to 10c/kg over quoted prices or first offers from the factories.”
The IFA Livestock leader said the base price for steers has risen with up to €4.10 paid. He said €4.05 to €4.10/kg base is on offer across the country and the base price for heifers is also well up with top prices of €4.25 paid. In general heifers are on a base price of €4.10 to €4.20/kg. Bulls are making from €4.00/4.10 for R grades and €4.10/4.20 for U grades. Cows are on €3.15 to €3.90/kg.
Cattle supplies have tightened considerably and the ongoing very tight supply of beef in the UK and across Europe is driving the trade here. Henry Burns said exports of finished cattle to Northern Ireland are also very strong driven by the significant better price return.
The IFA Livestock leader said the stronger trade for beef cattle was also being reflected in the mart trade with strong factory buying of early to slaughter stock. Hereford and Angus steers and heifers are in demand and quality continental cattle are a very good trade."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-demand-immediate-beef-price-increase/,2013-11-28,IFA Demand Immediate Beef Price Increase,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said cattle feeders are demanding an immediate 10c/kg beef price increase and need a substantial price lift before Christmas. He said with most of the grass cattle gone, the feeding costs on shed cattle are much higher and prices have to rise.
Henry Burns said this week supplies of in spec cattle are very tight and there was evidence that some factories were having to increase prices to get stock. “Some of the big groups have paid a steer base of €4.05/kg and offered €4.10 for later in the week and into next week to get the numbers. The word to agents is, don’t leave in spec cattle behind.”
Against this background and with UK prices hardening again at the equivalent of €4.98/kg, there is a solid case that cattle prices can rise in the run up to Christmas. Henry Burns said cattle feeders need to dig in hard and insist on a price rise straight away."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/farmer-anger-and-frustration-building-with-factories-on-cattle-price-ifa/,2013-12-09,Farmer Anger and Frustration Building with Factories on Cattle Price – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said there is real anger and frustration building among cattle farmers over the way they see factories holding back on a much needed beef price lift. He said since early November sterling has strengthened against the Euro adding to UK returns.
At the same time the British farmer price has held rock solid at £3.95 to £4.00/kg which is equivalent to almost €5.00/kg. “Clearly the factories have room to increase price to reflect the higher production costs.”
Henry Burns said the messages from the factories on price is sending a very negative signal to progressive finishers and both suckler and dairy beef breeders. He said some of the big processors have attacked the Quality Payment System in a very negative way attempting to impose dual base pricing and heavily discounting for non-quality assured stock as well as trying weight limits. Henry Burns said these were never part of the QPS and are nothing short of a move by some factories to undermine the system.
In addition, Henry Burns said it is extremely frustrating that some of the big factory groups who encouraged famers to keep bull calves from the dairy herd two years ago are now turning their back on these producers and not evening offering to bid on dairy beef bulls.
Henry Burns said some plants paid €4.05 base for steers and €4.15 for heifers with some top prices of €4.20/kg paid. He said young bulls are at €4.00/kg with some plants paying €4.10 for U grades and €4.00 for R grades this week."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/frustration-and-anger-building-on-beef-price-ifa/,2013-12-16,Frustration and Anger Building on Beef Price – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns accused the meat factories of sending confused and contradictory messages to farmers on the beef market and imposing new price cuts and specifications on a daily basis. He said this is extremely frustrating and angering feeders, particularly when they have cattle in the sheds feeding. He said feeders are at a loss to work out what they have to do for the factories to feed cattle and make a profit.
Henry Burns said the latest story from the factories is that they are now telling dairy farmers and feeders with Friesian bulls that they don’t want to buy them. He said two years ago, when numbers were very tight and live exports were strong, the factories pleaded with and promised farmers positive returns to keep Friesian bulls. They are now turning their backs on these feeders. Henry Burns said it is clear these animals would have been live exported as calves were it not for the promises and propaganda from the factories.
The IFA Livestock Leader said with such a large price gap between Irish prices and those in our main export market in the UK, there is little or no basis for any price pressure at the moment.
Henry Burns said UK farmers are also anger with the Irish processors for what they see as the under selling of Irish beef in the UK market.
The IFA Livestock leader said despite lots of negative propaganda from the factories, the prices of both steers and heifers remain stable at a base price of €4.00/kg for steers and €4.10/4.15 for heifers. He said feeders who have a mix of stock are negotiating up to €4.10 for U grade bulls."

He said that there is real anger building on the ground over the beef price and the way feeders see factories changing the specification to snooker the price. He said the most recent tactics of the factories on dual pricing, weight limits and age limits to undermine the beef price is totally unacceptable.
Henry Burns said warned the factories and their retail supermarket and food service clients that they could not completely ignore the concerns of famers and feeders, and chop and change the specification just to suit themselves.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/irish-beef-price-differential-with-great-britian-must-be-closed-ifa/,2013-12-19,Irish Beef Price Differential with Great Britian Must Be Closed – IFA,"Commenting on the report of the beef price differential between Northern Ireland and Great Britain published by the LMC this week, IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the report is very clear in identifying a significant price gap in the order of 14p to 21p/kg for prime R grade steers in the years 2009-2012 which is equivalent to €62 to €94 per animal. He said the report also highlights the fact that the price differential has widened significantly and was a lot higher in the Autumn of 2012 at over 40p/kg or €180 per head.
Henry Burns said in Ireland we know that the price differential between Irish cattle prices and those in Great Britain are much wider than those between Northern Ireland and GB. The facts are that the latest Bord Bia data for week ending December 7th shows that the price differential for R3 steers between Ireland and GB is currently at 83c/kg or €300per animal.
The IFA Livestock leader said the report is weak on identifying the lack of price competition as a factor for the price differential. However the report highlights the fact that “the live export trade to GB has been underutilised and recommends support for the live trade which in turn would help redress the price differential”.
Henry Burns said IFA has consistently highlighted the absence of a strong live export trade between Ireland and GB as a key reason for the unacceptable price differential. He said live exports are vital for price competition and the lack of price competition is the key factor why the price differential is so wide.
The IFA Livestock Leader said it is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture to provide market access for Irish farmers and ensure that there is proper price competition in the beef price and trade. He said Minister Coveney must tackle and resolve the issues that are denying Irish farmers open access and competition to the GB market for live cattle. “There is no doubt that this would increase Irish beef prices and help reduce the unacceptable price differential with GB.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-tackle-factories-on-bull-beef-price-cuts/,2014-01-02,IFA Tackle Factories on Bull Beef Price Cuts,"Together with bull beef finishers, IFA is arranging meetings with local factory management across the country over the factories unfair attack on the bull beef price. Henry Burns said members of the National livestock committee, county chairmen and bull beef finishers are meeting factory management at local level demanding that normal market conditions is restored to the bull beef situation.
At a meeting of the IFA National Livestock Management Committee in Dublin Henry Burns accused the meat factories of eroding confidence among beef finishers and deliberately attacking the bull beef price. He said there is real anger on the ground over the beef price and the way feeders see factories changing the specification to pull the price. He said the most recent tactics of the factories on dual pricing, weight limits and age limits to undermine the beef price is totally unacceptable. Some factories are openly telling feeders that they will not kill their bulls.
Henry Burns said warned the factories and their retail supermarket and food service clients that they could not completely ignore the concerns of famers and feeders, and chop and change the specification just to suit themselves. “The factories and retailers must provide reasonable timeframes for any changes on specifications.”
This is extremely frustrating and feeders are very angry, particularly when they have cattle in the sheds feeding. He said feeders are at a loss to work out what they have to do for the factories to feed cattle and make a profit.
Henry Burns said some of the latest story from the factories is that they are now telling dairy farmers and feeders with Friesian bulls that they don’t want to buy them. He said two years ago, when numbers were very tight and live exports were strong, the factories pleaded with and promised farmers positive returns to keep Friesian bulls. They are now turning their backs on these feeders. Henry Burns said it is clear these animals would have been live exported as calves were it not for the promises and propaganda from the factories.
Henry Burns said the attempt by the factories to impose a 16 month age limit on bulls in Ireland will not work. This erodes any bit of profit from our grass based systems and forces down an expensive grain based intensive system. It has major implications for our quality suckler cow herd and will scupper any chance of reaching the Food Harvest 2020 targets on beef.
The IFA Livestock Leader said with such a large price gap between Irish prices and those in our main export market in the UK, there is little or no basis for any price pressure at the moment.
Henry Burns said UK farmers are also anger with the Irish processors for what they see as the under selling of Irish beef in the UK market. Henry Burns said both the NFU and UFU have been in direct contact with the IFA complaining over the tactics of the Irish processors on prices.
The IFA Livestock leader said despite lots of negative propaganda from the factories, the prices of both steers and heifers remain stable at a base price of €4.00/kg for steers and €4.10/4.15 for heifers. He said bulls are trading at €3.85 to €4.00/kg."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-meet-mii-and-factories-on-bull-beef-problems-2/,2014-01-24,IFA Meet Mii and Factories on Bull Beef Problems,"IFA President Eddie Downey and an IFA delegation have met with Meat Industry Ireland and senior meat factories representatives in Dublin on the difficulties for bull beef producers. After the meeting, Eddie Downey said IFA made it very clear that prices must stabilise and the bull kill must increase over the coming weeks to help alleviate the difficulties.
Eddie Downey said, “IFA outlined to the factories that there is real frustration among beef finishers with the way bull beef prices have been cut in the last five weeks, and that producers are finding it difficult to get bulls killed”. He said nobody was left in any doubt that prices must be stabilised immediately and bulls must be killed before any weight or age restrictions are applied. In addition he said prices and deals must be honoured and any delay in getting cattle killed cannot result in a price cut.
The IFA President said factories have a real responsibility to resolve this problem and it must be resolved quickly. He warned that attempts by any factory to take advantage of the current difficulties would not be tolerated.
IFA Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said farmers with bulls are extremely annoyed with the factories and particularly the way they have cut the prices over the last five weeks. He said some feeders are struggling to get bulls killed and are being pushed back and back by the meat plants.
The IFA Livestock leader told the meat factories that there are serious implications for the beef sector going forward from this episode. He said farmers will be very reluctant to keep calves or weanlings where the specification for the finished bull is such that it is near impossible for anybody to make a margin other than the processor and retailer. In addition he said this has major implications for the agricultural sector and Food Harvest 2020."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-farmer-anger-at-breaking-point-over-factory-price-cuts-ifa/,2014-02-04,Cattle Farmer Anger at Breaking Point over Factory Price Cuts – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said anger among beef finishers was at breaking point over continuing factory beef price, cuts and he accused some processors of taking advantage of the difficulties on bulls to undermine in-spec steer and heifer prices.
  He said the reality is there is good market demand for in-spec steers and heifers and factories should be well capable of maintaining last week’s base prices of €4.00/kg for steers and €4.10/kg for heifers.
  Henry Burns said cattle feeders are very angry with the current tactics of the factories which are negative and damaging to their farmer suppliers and the livestock sector. He said the factories have a major responsibility to maintain confidence in the sector, and by continuing to cut prices they are seriously undermining confidence with major implications for future production.
  Henry Burns pointed out that in our largest export market in the UK, the sterling exchange rate had improved from 84p against the €uro in December to 82p over recent days, a gain worth of 10c/kg.
  In addition he said R grade steers in the UK are making £3.81/kg, which is the equivalent of €4.82/kg and heifers are making £3.78/kg, equivalent to €4.78/kg including vat. “At these price returns in our largest market, it is very difficult for farmers to understand why quotes were reduced again this week.”
  On the Continent, Henry Burns said bull prices in the main markets in like Italy, Germany, France and Spain have all improved since last December."

He warned that if cattle prices are not stabilised, the current crisis has the potential to totally derail the Food Harvest 2020 plan for the €2bn beef and livestock sector. He said, “It is not acceptable to farmers that Minister Coveney would consider he has no role with the factories on cattle prices.
  Eddie Downey said the collapse in bull beef prices has left winter finishers with serious financial losses.  “The impact is very severe at individual farm level with some finishers facing losses of up to €200 per head.”
  The IFA President said it is essential that the factories restore confidence into the beef trade at farm level and make it clear that bull beef prices have bottomed out and will not fall further. In addition, he said the factories have to send a clear signal to their suppliers that the price of In-spec steers and heifers will not come under further attack.
  IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said in 2011 and 2012, factories encouraged farmers to keep their dairy calves for beef and not export them. Farmers responded and now these same farmers cannot get their bulls killed, let alone get a viable price. Farmers feel the factories have reneged on their commitments and feel very let down. He said the strong signal is that dairy calves should be exported live in order to avoid damage to the beef price.
  He said the price cuts on bulls have seriously eroded the beef market with factories undercutting each other on our export markets. In addition, confidence at farm level has been eroded and needs to be restored. The suckler cow herd is under major threat and much tighter specifications on bulls in respect of age, weight and price will threaten numbers in the future. Winter finishing and year-round beef production to service the higher priced retail contracts is also under pressure.
  Henry Burns pointed out that the beef price crisis on bulls has major implications for the Food Harvest 2020 beef targets, exports and jobs involved in the beef sector.
  The IFA Livestock Leader said the price cuts must stop and factories must stabilise the market situation. Winter finishers have been hit with severe losses and they need to get cattle killed and especially bulls before any specification cuts are imposed.

Speaking following a visit to Spain by the IFA, organised by Bord Bia, Henry Burns said the Spanish importers and representatives of the Spanish feeders who he met believe imports from Ireland will increase in 2014.
  Henry Burns said Ireland exported 36,844 head of livestock to Spain last year and this figure has the potential to more than double in 2014. He said there is a strong opportunity to grow calf imports this Spring and ship more weanlings in the second half of the year.
  The IFA Livestock leader said, “The importers we met are of the view the Spanish sector is in recovery mode and will grow imports in 2014. Feed costs are down from last year and feeders are responding by importing more stock. In addition, beef prices have strengthened”.
  In total, Spain imports between 400,000 and 500,000 head of livestock on an annual basis. The main suppliers are France, Poland, Ireland, Germany and Romania. Feedlot owners in Spain said that live exports to the Middle East and North Africa had provided a strong competitive boost to their trade over the last two years.
  Spanish farmers are looking to import calves that are 4 to 5 weeks old and in the 53kg to 60kg weight range.  On weanlings, Spanish feeders are looking for an average to good Continental cross bull and heifer ranging from 270kgs to 350kgs.
  In 2010, Henry Burns pointed out that Ireland exported 338,000 head of livestock, tightening supplies and driving up cattle prices in 2012 and 2013. “There is no reason why calf exports cannot hit 160,000 head again in 2014, as recent events on bull prices show that keeping male dairy calves in the country is a major negative for the Irish beef sector.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-call-on-minister-coveney-to-convene-an-emergency-beef-summit/,2014-02-13,IFA Call on Minister Coveney to Convene an Emergency Beef Summit,"IFA President Eddie Downey has called on the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney to call an emergency Beef Summit involving the meat factories, the IFA, Bord Bia and Teagasc to tackle the crisis developing on cattle prices and farm incomes, particularly for winter finishers and bull beef finishers.
  Eddie Downey said the recent beef price cuts have severely damaged confidence at farm level and he warned Minister Coveney that if cattle prices are not stabilised, the Food Harvest 2020 targets for the €2bn beef and livestock sector will collapse, with major implications for exports and jobs at farm and processing level.
  The IFA President said, “It is not acceptable to farmers, that Minister Coveney would consider he has no role with the factories on cattle prices”. He said there must be a real link between all the announcements and progress on new and better markets for Irish beef, and viable cattle prices at farm level.
  Eddie Downey said the collapse in bull beef prices has left winter finishers with serious financial losses.  “The impact is very severe at individual farm level, with some finishers facing losses of up to €200 per head.”
  The IFA President said it is essential that the factories restore confidence into the beef trade at farm level and make it clear that bull beef prices have bottomed out and will not fall further. In addition, he said the factories have to send a clear signal to their suppliers that the price of In-spec steers and heifers will not come under further attack.
  IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said there is real anger and frustration at farm level with the problems on price and particularly not being able to get cattle killed. In 2011 and 2012, factories encouraged farmers to keep their dairy calves for beef and not export them. Farmers responded and now these same farmers cannot get their bulls killed, let alone get a viable price. Farmers feel the factories have reneged on their commitments and feel very let down.

  Following a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture this week, IFA President Eddie Downey said Minister Coveney will call in the chief executives of the meat factories tomorrow over the difficulties in the beef sector and the unacceptable fall in prices and incomes for bull beef producers.
  Eddie Downey said IFA made it clear to Minister Coveney that action must be taken to address the situation and restore stability and confidence in the beef sector. He said the changes to specifications and the bull beef price cuts of €150 to €300 per head had inflicted serious losses at farm level and left some winter finishers with major financial difficulties.
  Minister Coveney said he understood the seriousness of the situation for the beef sector and that he will take immediate action and call in the meat factory bosses.
  IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said what has happened at the factories on specifications and prices since the New Year is totally unacceptable. He said despite the fact that the weekly kill at the factories is only 31,000, farmers cannot get their cattle killed and many are being pushed back week after week into over age and overweight price cuts. He told the Minister the factory price cuts at farm level have seriously eroded confidence.
  Henry Burns told Minister Coveney there are serious implications for the beef sector and the targets set down in Food Harvest 2020, if the problems in the beef market are not addressed and prices stabilised. He said the suckler herd is under severe pressure and the price cuts and specification limits will compound this situation, despite the positive move by the Government to introduce an €80 cow/calf payment under the new genomic scheme from 2015."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/farmers-to-protest-over-factory-price-cuts-and-specification-ifa/,2014-02-27,Farmers to Protest over Factory Price Cuts and Specification – IFA,"IFA President Eddie Downey said factory beef price cuts and specifications changes are eroding confidence in the beef sector, especially in winter finishing.  He said the move by the factories to hit prime in-spec steers and heifers with new price and weight cuts this week, following their meeting with Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney, was a step too far and shows scant disregard for both the Minister and farmer suppliers.
  Announcing details of a  beef farmers’ protest at the Department of Agriculture in Dublin next Tues, March 4th, Eddie Downey said farmer anger and frustration with the beef cuts was boiling over and winter finishers cannot endure any more losses. He said, “The time has come for Minister Coveney to stand up for farmers and reject the factories’ tactics. The Minister must insist that stability and confidence are restored to the beef sector”.
  Eddie Downey said Minister Coveney must also tackle the lack of competition in the beef sector and take action to close the large price gap between Irish beef prices and those in our main export market in Great Britain. “IFA has worked hard to secure a new ferry route for live cattle to the UK. The Minister must remove the artificial blockages preventing the expansion of the live trade, including the labelling difficulties. This is a market access issue preventing the operation of the EU single market.”
  In addition, the IFA President said farmers are concerned that factories are being allowed use the Department of Agriculture AIMS database to monitor livestock numbers on individual farmers. We want a guarantee from the Minister that the AIMS system is absolutely confidential and factories do not have access to the herd profile of individual farmers.
  Eddie Downey said the collapse in bull beef prices since last December has inflicted severe losses on winter finishers and seriously eroded confidence and morale across the beef sector. Some bull beef finishers are taking a financial hit of €200 to €300 per head and struggling to get cattle killed before more severe price and spec cuts are applied. He said income losses at finishing level will also impact on store and weanling producers.
  The IFA President said the factories and their supermarket clients cannot change the goalposts with new specifications in the middle of the production season. He said farmers calving cows or buying cattle this Spring are at a loss as to the direction they should take.
  IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the latest round of factory cuts and limits on in-spec cattle was avoidable as our main markets in the UK and across Europe show signs of stability. In the UK, EBLEX are reporting ‘an uplift in live weight prices and firmer consumer demand’.  The price of R4L steers in Great Britain is £3.75/kg, equivalent to €4.74/kg incl vat. “With such a large gap between Irish and GB prices, the factories cannot justify a price cut on prime in-spec steers and heifers.”
  Henry Burns said despite the fact that the weekly kill at the factories is only 31,500, farmers cannot get their cattle killed and many are being pushed back week after week into over age and overweight price cuts.
  He said there are serious implications for the beef sector and the targets set down in Food Harvest 2020, if the problems in the beef market are not addressed and prices stabilised quickly. He said the suckler herd is under severe pressure and the price cuts and specification limits will untimately hit weanling and store prices, compound this situation.
  The IFA Livestock Leader said the recent market developments have left farmers very sceptical about the expansion plans on beef. “The minute the beef kill goes over 30,000 head per week, the price seems to hit the deck. Farmers believe a strong live export trade for Friesian calves to Spain and Holland, weanlings to Continental EU markets and stores to North Africa are essential to keep a competitive balance in the trade.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/time-for-minister-to-act-on-beef-crisis-review-of-food-harvest-2020-plans-ifa-president-tells-major-protest/,2014-03-04,"Time for Minister to Act on Beef Crisis & Review of Food Harvest 2020 Plans, IFA President Tells Major Protest","Addressing a major protest of beef farmers outside the Department of Agriculture today (Tues), IFA President Eddie Downey said Minister Simon Coveney’s Food Harvest 2020 plan is failing beef farmers, who face losses up to €175m this year if beef prices are not restored.
  Eddie Downey, who will also address the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture this afternoon, challenged the Minister to take action on a number of critical issues for the sector. He said, “The Minister must reject the factory cuts and specification changes and act immediately to address labelling and live export issues that are curtailing competition and the movement of stock to our key markets, including Northern Ireland and the UK. The sector needs stability and confidence to be restored without any further delay”.
  “At the moment, winter finishers and particularly bull beef finishers are in the eye of the storm. Some bull beef finishers are at their wits end, unable to get cattle killed. When they do sell them, they are facing price cuts of 50c/kg plus, ranging from €200 to €300 per head. These farmers are facing very real and very substantial financial losses this spring.”
  “Compared to this time last year, steer and heifers are down €70 to €80 /head. Bull beef and cow prices are down €180 to €200/head.  If these beef prices are not restored, the losses to the Irish beef sector will be in the order of €175m per annum. This would totally derail the Food Harvest 2020 plan”, Eddie Downey said.
  The Minister must get Teagasc, Bord Bia, ICBF, the factories and most importantly the IFA representing farmers around the table and revisit the Food Harvest beef activation plans. For example, under-16 month bull beef production doesn’t work in a grass based system and tight carcase weights will leave our quality Continental cross suckler cows uneconomical. At a minimum, farmers are entitled to have clear and stable market signals and a production system that is viable.
  IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said IFA has worked hard to secure a new ferry route for live cattle to the UK.  Minister Coveney must act to remove the artificial blockages preventing the expansion of the live trade to the UK, including addressing the labelling difficulties. This is a market access issue, which is preventing the proper operation of the EU single market. It has also hit the important store trade with Northern Ireland, affecting the mart trade and suckler farmers all across the West and Midlands.
  Henry Burns said, “IFA is calling on the Minister and Bord Bia to go to the UK and meet with the supermarket bosses and their Government and agency counterparts to resolve these difficulties. Doing nothing on this is no longer acceptable. The large price gap between Irish and UK cattle prices must be closed. It is not acceptable that Irish cattle are being blocked out of part of the single EU market”.
  The Minister must also become an advocate of the live export trade to European and other markets; by doing so he will improve price competition and increase market outlets.
  Henry Burns said, “Farmers are very clear that a strong live export trade for Friesian calves to Spain and Holland, weanlings to Continental EU markets and stores to North Africa are essential to keep a competitive balance in the trade. As things stand, the more Friesian calves that go out the better"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-meet-ulster-farmers-union-on-beef-issues/,2014-03-12,IFA Meet Ulster Farmers Union on Beef Issues,"IFA President Eddie Downey led an IFA delegation including National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns in a meeting with the Ulster Farmers Union in Dublin this week where the current problems on beef prices and specifications both North and South were discussed. The UFU were represented by their President Harry Sinclair, Deputy President Ian Marshall and Chief Executive Clarke Black.
  Both the IFA and the UFU were very clear that the recent factory beef price cuts and specification changes were seriously eroding confidence in the beef sector on the island and had inflicted excessive financial damage on winter finishers.
  In relation to specification, Eddie Downey said, “Both processors and retailers North and South have to understand the grass-based production systems in Ireland and the smaller family farming structure, and appreciate that cattle have to move from breeding to weaning to fattening farms.  This essential movement is efficiently facilitated in an open and competitive fashion through livestock marts all across the island”.
  He added that adjustments need to be made to the current in spec requirement of 4 farm residences in the South in order to better accommodate the sale and movements of animals. In addition, the final residency requirement must be adjusted to accommodate the sale of finished cattle through the marts.
  On age, Eddie Downey said IFA is proposing that the current 30-month age limit on steers and heifers be adjusted upwards to 36 months. He said the 30-month age limit was outdated and no longer appropriate, and this move would provide important flexibility to producers.
  On bulls, the IFA President said the established practice for the UK market was 16 months of age, but this system did not suit the grass based production in southern Ireland. 18 to 24 month old bulls were much more suited to Irish conditions and European markets, where half our exports go. “Contracts are very important for bull beef producers and processors need to work with farmers on expanding this.  Bull beef was essential to keeping a year round beef supply in the chain”.
  The IFA President said a strong live export trade for male calves from the dairy herd was also essential to keep the beef trade in balance and avoid the problems that had occurred this spring.
  He said processor moves to try and impose uneconomic weight penalties were unacceptable and would only inflict further pressure on our valuable Continental breed suckler cow herd.
  Eddie Downey briefed the UFU on the IFA campaign to reduce the unacceptable price gap between Irish cattle prices and those in our main export market in the UK. He said IFA is insisting Minister Coveney takes action on price competition and removes the artificial blockages restricting the operation of the single market with the live export trade of cattle to Northern Ireland and Great Britain. “IFA is insisting that Minister Coveney and Bord Bia goes directly to meet his counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain as well as the key retail groups to make progress on this major issue.”
  Eddie Downey said IFA had a good meeting with the UFU and both organisations will continue to work hard together to restore confidence and viable prices to the important beef farming sector both North and South."

  Henry Burns said the live trade to the North and Great Britain is a major issue and it is the direct responsibility of Minister Coveney to ensure that the EU single market is working properly for Irish farmers. He said “Over 3,000 farmers protested outside the Department of Agriculture two weeks ago. Livestock farmers are demanding Minister Coveney and Bord Bia engage with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain as well as the major retail and processing groups and insist that Irish livestock are not blocked out of the market with artificial anticompetitive barriers.”
  Henry Burns said IFA held discussions with farming representatives from all across the UK on the current problems on beef prices and specifications. The National Farmers Union (NFU) from England and Wales, NFU Scotland and the Ulster Farmers Union were all involved in the discussions.
  “All representatives were very clear that the recent factory beef price cuts and abrupt changes to specification were damaging confidence in the beef sector and had inflicted significant pressure on winter finishers. “
  The IFA Livestock leader said it was agreed that the IFA, NFU and UFU would continue to work closely together on the beef issues, and would have a more co-ordinated approach on the huge range of specifications that apply across the same markets.
  He said, “It is not acceptable that some factories are attempting to apply an uneconomic 400kg weight limit here and the same meat company dealing with the same retailers in the same market are operating a 450kg limit in other jurisdictions”.
  Henry Burns said there are other specification issues such as final residencies periods ranging from 70 days down to zero and different requirements on the number of farm residences, but all of the beef is being supplied to the same UK market.
  The IFA Livestock leader said both processors and retailers in Ireland and the UK have to understand the grass-based production systems in Ireland and the smaller family farming structure, and appreciate that cattle have to move from breeding to weaning to fattening farms.
He said this essential movement is efficiently facilitated in an open and competitive fashion through livestock marts. He added that adjustments need to be made to the current in spec requirement of four farm residences in the South in order to better accommodate the sale and movements of animals. In addition, he said the final residency requirement must be adjusted to accommodate the sale of finished cattle through the marts.
  The IFA Livestock Leader said a strong live export trade for male calves from the dairy herd was also essential to keep the beef trade in balance and avoid the problems that had occurred this spring.
  Henry Burns said that cattle prices remain very difficult at unacceptable low levels for winter finishers. He said there are some indications that the market situation was improving with prices in the UK and across Europe showing some positive movements. In addition he said some retailers were offering promotions, which was moving beef in stock and demand is expected to pick up strongly for Easter. “The improvement in the weather and grass growth should also boost the cattle trade and improve confidence at farm level.”
  The IFA Livestock leader said across Europe price remain stable with Bord Bia reporting prices for R3 bulls in Italy at the equivalent of €4.33/kg incl vat. In France young bulls are at €4.06/kg and at €3.99/kg in Germany. Henry Burns said male cattle are making over €4.00/kg in the main markets across Europe.
  Henry Burns said based on the current market returns, where prices are very strong in our main market in the UK and prices are stable or improving across Europe, factories should be well capable of restoring cattle prices to viable levels."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-will-judge-beef-forum-based-on-restoring-profitability/,2014-04-23,Farmers Will Judge Beef Forum Based on Restoring Profitability,"IFA President Eddie Downey has said the IFA delegation attending the recent Beef Summit organised by the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney strongly reflected the anger and frustration of winter finishers following the collapse in prices and changes to specifications over the winter period.
He said the clear message to the Minister and the factories was that the decimation of margins for winter finishers cannot be allowed to happen again. Eddie Downey said the package of measures put forward by the Minister, while welcome, are not at all sufficient to address the issues in the livestock sector.
The IFA President said returning profit to the beef sector is vital and the immediate priority for the forum must be to address the beef specification concerns, contracts and premiums for winter finishing, restrictions on cattle movements, labelling and North/South trade issues.
The IFA President said farmers would judge this process on the basis of their concerns being fully addressed. He said, “The prices they secure from the market must fully reflect the work and investment involved in producing quality stock”.
At the summit, Eddie Downey also highlighted the need for the Minister for Agriculture to reject outright any attempt to reach a deal with the Mercosur group that would damage vital European beef and pork markets."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/high-level-ifanfu-meeting-in-london-on-beef-price-issue/,2014-06-11,High Level Ifa/nfu Meeting in London on Beef Price Issue,"In an unprecedented move, farming leaders from Great Britain and Ireland met in London this week for a Presidential Summit on the current difficulties in the beef sector. IFA President Eddie Downey and National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns met with the President of the NFU Meurig Raymond and other senior NFU representatives from England, Wales, Scotland and the UFU from Northern Ireland on the beef situation.
All of the organisations were unanimous that the current downward spiral of farmgate prices is causing serious damage to the livestock sector and farmers’ confidence. Retailers, processors and caterers must all take responsibility for the decisions they make and the impact those decisions have on the sustainability of the beef sector.
Eddie Downey said there was strong agreement that the consumption issue must be tackled and there is a real opportunity and need for retailers to undertake more promotions. In addition, there was a call for long-term signals from both retailers and processors that instil confidence in the beef sector, and an end to the short-termism that damages confidence that threatens the long-term future of the beef supply. The farm leaders had discussions around the various promotional agencies working closer together on generic promotion of beef on the UK market.
The IFA President said, “With a reduced beef supply forecast in the UK towards the end of this year, and a forecast reduction in Irish cattle numbers in 2015 and 2016, there needs to be a change of attitude and a realisation that retailers, processors and farmers must work to a long-term plan. The reality is beef supply is not a tap that can be turned on and off at a moment’s notice”.
NFU President Meurig Raymond said, “All attendees were determined to work together to resolve the current issues facing the beef industry. Consumers made it clear during horsegate that they value shorter supply chains, with provenance high on their agenda. At that time major retailers made statements of the importance of economically sustainable supply chains and a commitment to build confidence with producers for a long term supply of beef. Now is the time that is going to test how deep those commitments run”.
Imports was also looked at and while the level of beef imported from countries outside the EU remains small, and Irish beef continues to make up the majority (70 per cent) of beef imports to the UK, all UK and Irish farm leaders stood united on the need for government and businesses to work to ensure that any beef imports meet exactly the same high standards as those asked of British and Irish assured beef. It is critical that beef, and products containing beef, are clearly labelled with the country in which that beef was produced, so that consumers can exercise choice as to where the beef they are eating has come from.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said “It was clear from our discussions that the beef price situation is very serious. Farmers across the UK and Ireland have had enough and can take no more price pressure. It was also clear that there is more than sufficient margin across the beef supply chain for farmers, the processors and retailers, provided it was distributed on a more equitable basis”.
Henry Burns said the meeting also discussed a number of important action points including lobbying Ministers and Governments, insisting that they get involved and take action on the beef issue as well as defending the livestock sector against Mercosur and TTIP. In addition, he said many other issues around specifications and Codes of Conduct for processors were discussed.
 "
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-coveney-and-state-agencies-must-address-beef-crisis/,2014-06-18,Minister Coveney and State Agencies Must Address Beef Crisis,"Speaking at the Teagasc Beef Open day in Grange in Co Meath today, IFA President Eddie Downey said there is real anger and frustration on the ground among the country’s 100,000 livestock farmers over the income crisis in the beef sector.
He said it is incredible that the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney would indicate that he is powerless and can do nothing with the meat factories over the way they are abusing farmers on the Quality payment system and beef specifications cuts. In addition, Eddie Downey said the Minister must address the lack of progress in removing the roadblocks impeding the live trade to Northern Ireland, vital for price competition.
Eddie Downey said farmers do not accept that the Minister is powerless with the factories. He said, “The Minister must address this issue immediately in order to restore confidence before more damage is inflicted on producers”.
The IFA President said Teagasc needed to immediately undertake a full and proper analysis of the implications of the beef specification cuts being implemented by the factories on farmers and the Irish beef sector. He said the factory proposal to impose a 380kg carcase weight limit will have a devastating impact on our quality suckler cow herd. In addition Teagasc need to highlight the facts around the uneconomic returns and unsuitability of under-16 month bull beef systems being promoted by the factories in our grass-based, production systems.
Eddie Downey said farmers are concerned with the changes to the Teagasc blueprint on suckling along the lines they have introduced in the Derrypatrick herd in Grange. He cautioned against abrupt changes to production systems and breeds.
The IFA President said farmers had learned a very expensive lesson from the experience of following the lead from factories two years ago where they were strongly encouraged to keep their dairy bred calves for bull beef production. He said the reality this spring was the same factories walked away from buying these cattle at a viable price and farmers suffered severe financial losses.
Eddie Downey also called on Teagasc to undertake a major communication programme with livestock farmers through marts, meat plants, farmer meetings, and discussion groups across all of the key areas on research, production and marketing in order to improve efficiency and incomes.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said livestock farmers have encountered severe financial losses this spring and can take no more. He said its time Minister Coveney stood up for livestock farmers and restored some confidence back into the sector. He said farmers are sick and tired listening to the Minister telling everybody how good things are and singing the praises of the processing industry, when beef prices have plummeted and livestock farm incomes are on the floor. Teagasc recently confirmed the facts that livestock farm incomes are down 13% to 22% last year, at extremely low levels ranging from €9,469 to €15,595.”
Compared to this time last year, beef prices are down 15% to 20%. Steer prices are down 70c/kg, which is equivalent to €280 per head on a 400kg animal. Across a full year a price reduction of this magnitude, discounting for increased supplies, would amount to a massive reduction of €370m in the value of beef output and exports.
Henry Burns said the failure of Minister Coveney to challenge the factories on the beef price and specification issues at the Beef Forum is being used by the factories as a licence to drive on and implement these severe cuts across the board. He said the Minister is allowing the factories to get away with imposing totally unfair and unnecessary cuts on farmers."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-announces-autumn-livestock-meetings-tackling-the-challenges-in-beef/,2014-08-07,IFA Announces Autumn Livestock Meetings – Tackling the Challenges in Beef,"Announcing a series of IFA meetings for livestock farmers this autumn, the IFA President Eddie Downey said the first meeting will take place in the Ardboyne Hotel in Navan, Co. Meath on Tues, August 19th at 8.30pm. Further meetings have been arranged in September for Tullamore, Kilkenny and Tipperary.
Eddie Downey said livestock farmers cannot go through another year like the last 12 months. He said, “IFA is determined that the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must sort out the key issues that are challenging the livestock sector and negatively impacting on farm incomes. The beef sector is in a very difficult position and must be improved”.
The IFA livestock farmers meeting in Navan will be addressed by the President Eddie Downey, the IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns, Joe Burke from An Bord Bia and representatives of the meat processing industry.
Inviting all farmers to attend, Eddie Downey said the theme of the meeting is “Tackling the Challenges in Beef”. He said it will provide an opportunity for farmers to get the latest information on cattle supplies, market prospects and prices as well as specifications and live exports.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the IFA campaign over the last few months has put the beef crisis top of the agenda and Minister Coveney must now deliver on the key issues. “The Minister must get a lot tougher with the meat factories, insist that they honour the agreement they have with farmers on the Quality Payment System and remove the unfair specifications cuts on dual pricing, weights and breeds that were never part of the QPS.”
In addition, Henry Burns said Minister Coveney must insist that the roadblocks impeding the important live export trade to Northern Ireland are removed, and competition and the single market are allowed to freely operate. He said, “IFA has been working hard with processors in Northern Ireland and branding solutions have been put forward which can resolve this issue. Minister Coveney needs to strongly support these solutions, as time is running out before the autumn trade intensifies”.
Henry Burns said it is Minister Coveney’s job to ensure that there is strong competition and transparency in the beef sector and insist that prices fairly reflect market returns.

Eddie Downey said livestock farmers cannot survive another year of severe price and income cuts.
Eddie Downey said “The responsibility lies squarely with the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney to address the key challenges for livestock farmers. We expect him to take a much more hands on approach in tackling the issues that are negatively impacting on farm incomes”.  He said after concerted pressure from IFA the Minister conceded to the establishment of a Beef Forum and it’s now time for real progress and results.
The IFA President said the Minister cannot allow the factories to continue to ignore him and undermine confidence in the livestock sector. He said “Minister Coveney must assert his authority with the factories and insist that they respect the agreement they entered into with farmers on the price grid under the Quality Payment System”. He must insist the factories remove the unfair specifications cuts on dual pricing, weights, age and breeds that were never part of the QPS.
In addition, Eddie Downey said Minister Coveney must remove the roadblocks impeding the important live export trade to Northern Ireland so that competition and the single market are allowed to freely operate. He said “IFA has been working hard with processors in Northern Ireland and branding solutions have been put forward which can resolve this issue. Minister Coveney needs to strongly support these solutions, as time is running out before the autumn trade intensifies.”
In addition, the IFA President said it is Minister Coveney’s job to ensure that there is strong competition and transparency in the beef sector and insist that prices fairly reflect market returns. He said the Minister needs to do a lot more to restore confidence and the Beef Forum has to deliver on the key issues around restoring prices and incomes, the QPS price grid, specifications, contracts and live exports.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said moves by the meat factories to try and impose further cattle price cuts this week are totally unjustified as prices in our main market in the UK have stabilised in recent weeks and remain well ahead of Irish levels. Henry Burns accused the factories of a new breach of faith with farmers in trying to impose new and deeper specification cuts on age in a move to force out cattle. He said the factories are back to their old tricks this week of intimidating and bullying farmers by threating more price cuts if they don’t sell, using the 30 month age as the main lever.
Following a series of meetings with the main banks, IFA President Eddie Downey said IFA has secured a commitment from the banks that they will support farmers during the current difficulties and provide the same level of working capital in the form of stocking loans and overdraft facilities in 2014, as in previous years. Eddie Downey said this is an important positive message to livestock farmers as they enter the autumn sales and should help to restore confidence to the sector.
National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said IFA recently met with the ICOS Marts to discuss credit facilities and other issues. On the security of payment for the sale of livestock the IFA message to farmers is very clear. “Sell your livestock in your local licenced mart.”"

The IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman said very good progress has being made in resolving the problems impeding the live export trade to Northern Ireland. He said following work by IFA with processors in Northern Ireland, proposals were put to the Department of Agriculture in the North and Northern Minister Michelle O Neill has now given approval for an Irish brand to be used on cattle exported from the south, fattened in Northern Ireland and subsequently slaughtered in the North.
Henry Burns said this is a significant development and should pave the way for cattle exported from the south to feeders in the North and slaughtered in the North to be branded and sold as Irish, removing any confusion on the origin. He said this beef will be labelled in full compliance with EU regulations specifying that the animals were born in Ireland, reared in the UK and slaughtered in the UK.
Henry Burns said IFA has been working on this issue for a number of months and this is a significant breakthrough in the work to get a solution. He said the processing sector in Northern Ireland are confident that the next step in this process should be lead to a resolution of the issue, which in turn will see an increase in live exports to Northern Ireland.

The IFA Livestock Leader said the live trade to Northern Ireland is hugely important for price competition, particularly for store and weanling producers in the West and border counties. He said with sterling at 79p against the €uro and a significant shortage of cattle in Northern Ireland the potential for this trade over the autumn and into 2015 is very significant. In the past up to with good competition 60,000 to 70,000 cattle have moved North.
Henry Burns said there has been a good increase in live exports to the North in recent week in anticipation of a resolution to this problem and also on the back of sterling and a dry up in numbers in the North. In addition, Henry Burns said the large gap between cattle prices in Northern Ireland and south is pulling more and more finished cattle North for slaughter.

He said “With beef prices in our main markets in the UK and across the EU stable and recovering, the current attack on prices by the factories cannot be justified. The anger and frustration of farmers over the way their incomes have been decimated is very real and farmers feel betrayed by the unacceptable behaviour of retailers and processors this year.”
The suggestion of further retailer specifications cuts was rejected outright by the IFA President. He said its time the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney, Bord Bia and the meat processors fought back against these specification cuts, which are extremely damaging to the Irish beef sector and our top quality grass based beef production systems.
The IFA President told the meeting that the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must deliver on his commitment to beef farmers and the Beef Forum must start delivering some results for farmers.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-take-beef-campaign-to-mcdonalds/,2014-09-03,IFA Take Beef Campaign to Mcdonalds,"Speaking at a livestock farmers protest outside McDonalds restaurant in Kilkenny today (Wed), IFA President Eddie Downey said it is totally unacceptable that everybody in the beef supply chain was standing back and letting farmers take the full financial hit in this crisis.
The IFA President said farmers feel betrayed by the unacceptable behaviour and lack of corporate responsibility on the part of the powerful players in the supply chain including meat factories, retailers and food service outlets like McDonalds, Burger King and Supermacs.
Eddie Downey said the lack of engagement and progress in efforts at resolving the price and specification cuts was infuriating for farmers who feel they are being let down badly. “With beef prices down by €200 per head from last year and at incomes ranging from €9,469 to €15,595, as confirmed by Teagasc, livestock farmers feel angry and frustrated that their issues are being ignored.” He said with beef prices in our main markets in the UK, and across the EU, stable and recovering, the most recent price cuts by the factories cannot be justified.
The IFA President said purchasers of Irish beef heavily utilise our high quality, grass-based beef production systems to gain market advantage. “These marketing drives around environmental sustainability using Origin Green and Quality Assurance are positive and justified, but they also carry a core corporate responsibility to ensure economic sustainability for farmers.”
Acknowledging the high quality and standards of McDonalds Europe and their commitment to Irish beef, Eddie Downey said Irish farmers like their EU colleagues are entitled to a viable income for their work and investment.
Eddie Downey said following on from the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney’s meeting with the meat processors yesterday, he must assert his authority and demand that the factories respect the agreement they entered into with farmers on the price grid under the Quality Payment System. He said the Minister must insist that the factories remove the unfair specifications cuts on dual pricing, weights, age and breeds that were never part of the QPS.

He added that Ministers Simon Coveney and Michelle O’Neill must now ensure that the supermarkets adopt these labels, which are mandatory under EU regulations.
In addition, Henry Burns said Minister Coveney must deliver 100% of the CAP direct payments early this year on October 16th and ensure full funding in the Budget to provide for a GLAS payment for 30,000 farmers.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-president-says-minister-coveney-must-deliver-for-livestock-farmers/,2014-09-04,IFA President Says Minister Coveney Must Deliver for Livestock Farmers,"Speaking ahead of the IFA livestock meeting in Castlerea tonight, IFA President Eddie Downey said Minister Simon Coveney will have to remain centrally involved to ensure genuine progress is made in resolving the price and specification cuts that have so badly damaged confidence in the beef sector this year.  Earlier, livestock farmers held their latest protest at the Lidl supermarket in the town. 
Eddie Downey said farmers want to know what Meat Industry Ireland, which represents meat processors, meant when it told the Minister it is willing to explore flexibilities. “IFA will engage to address the real issues, but it is essential the Minister remains fully engaged to ensure a positive outcome and fair play for farmers.”
The IFA President said Teagasc has confirmed that livestock farmers’ incomes are down by 13%-22% in the last year, ranging from €9,469 to €15,595. “With beef prices in our main markets in the UK and across Europe now stabilised and recovering, it’s time the processors started to secure prices from the market place that restored viability and confidence to the sector.”
Eddie Downey said the Minister will have to make it clear to processors that their agreement with farmer suppliers has to be fully honoured through the price grid, or Quality Payment System. Specification cuts on dual pricing, weights and age penalties, which were not part of the original QPS, have to be removed.
He said, “Specifications that target the suckler cow herd and Ireland’s grass-based production systems are extremely damaging. Weight limits that penalise our quality cattle from the suckler herd are a non-runner. Greater availability of contracts for livestock farmers is essential. With the Budget just over a month away, Minister Coveney has to deliver funding for a GLAS scheme, which will be an important element of income for suckler farmers”.
In addition, Eddie Downey said there has to be clear transparency on market returns and more competition in the trade. He said a strong live export trade is essential and Minister Coveney must secure an effective solution to the roadblocks impeding the live trade to Northern Ireland, which is important for competition for farmers and the marts trade in the west of Ireland.
The IFA President said that the Association’s work on live exports is having a major impact on supplies, with 150,000 fewer cattle available next year and a further reduction of 100,000 in 2016. The overhang of over 100,000 extra cattle/bulls is now gone out of the system and with market balance being restored, higher cattle prices will have to be secured by processors from the market place. The future of the livestock sector is in the balance and the Minister will have live up to his recent commitment to deliver for farm families in the sector.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/mii-response-fails-to-address-key-issues-minister-coveney-must-intervene-ifa/,2014-09-18,Mii Response Fails to Address Key Issues & Minister Coveney Must Intervene – IFA,"IFA President Eddie Downey said the response of Meat Industry Ireland (MII) to the Dowling Report is totally inadequate, lacks specifics and fails to address the issues raised by farmers with the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney.
Eddie Downey said the failure of the meat factories to deal in detail with the real issues that are at the core of the current crisis further highlights the urgent need for the Minister for Agriculture to show real leadership and immediately convene and chair a meeting between IFA and meat factories.
The IFA President said the key issues that are causing the most financial hardship for livestock farmers are the application by factories of unacceptable and unjustifiable price and spec cuts for weight and age in the Quality Payment System (QPS). “These price penalties were not part of the original QPS and are being used as a tool to devalue livestock. The analysis by MII of the prime cattle kill is simplistic and ignores the real issue, which is the damaging impact these cuts have on the cattle bred from our suckler herd”.
He said if the MII claim in their response that the QPS remains at the heart of their payment system, then livestock farmers from today should only be quoted one base price for their cattle with the practice of different prices depending on weight, age and breed which has been common practice, immediately discontinued. He said beef finishers should insist on this.
IFA Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said claims by the factories that farmers have not advanced efficiency ignores the high participation rates of farmers in schemes such as BTAP, the Beef Genomics scheme and the €20m they have invested to-date in the BVD eradication scheme.
Furthermore, he said the penalties meat factories want to persist in applying for age and weight limits prevent farmers from maximising grass based production, which is the production method which gives Irish beef its competitive advantage in the market place and minimises production costs.
Henry Burns said Teagasc figures clearly show that it is our most efficient farmers that are the ones hardest hit by the imposition of weight and age cuts. Even on these farms, Teagasc show a price of €4.50/kg is needed to make a margin in winter production and farmers expect to hear from their factories what contracts and other commitments are available this winter.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/rising-beef-market-in-the-uk-must-lift-irish-prices-ifa/,2014-09-25,Rising Beef Market in the Uk Must Lift Irish Prices – IFA,"Speaking at the National Ploughing Championships, IFA President Eddie Downey said cattle prices are turning with factories having to pay 5c to 10c per kg above quotes prices to get stock this week. “With an increase of 27c/kg or €100 per head in finished cattle prices in our main export market in the UK since early July, there is major market potential for Irish cattle prices to increase substantially.”
Eddie Downey said prices are going to have to increase significantly to cover the costs of production and leave a margin for farmers. In addition, he said the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney has to come off the side-lines and get involved centre stage in resolving the issues around the difficulties in the beef sector with the factories. He said farmers simply cannot understand why the Minister is so unwilling to get involved and assist beef producers, who have the lowest incomes in farming.
Eddie Downey said factories have been forced to move the base price up to €3.65/€3.70/kg for both steers and heifers this week. Bull prices have also moved up to €3.70/kg for U grades and cow prices have also lifted by 5c to 10c per kg.
He said if the MII claim that the QPS remains at the heart of their payment system, then livestock farmers from this week should only be quoted one base price for their cattle, with the practice of different prices depending on weight, age and breed which has been common practice, immediately discontinued. He said the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must insist that the factories honour this with farmers.
The IFA Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said with an additional 126,000 cattle already processed this year and an additional 30,000 animals exported live, the supply of finished cattle to meet increased market demand was tightening and factories agents were actively chasing cattle and offering farmers more to get supplies this week. He said the AIMS data is pointing to a reduction of 150,000 head in finished cattle supplies over the next year.
Henry Burns said the key issues that are causing severe financial hardship for livestock farmers are the application by factories of unacceptable and unjustifiable price and spec cuts for weight and age in the Quality Payment System (QPS). “These price penalties were not part of the original QPS and are being used as a tool to devalue livestock.”
On removing the roadblocks impeding the live export trade to Northern Ireland, Henry Burns said the beef branding concept being pushed by the IFA specifically for cattle born in the ROI and slaughtered in Northern Ireland is progressing, but needs the full backing of the Ministers for Agriculture both North and South. He said Tesco has confirmed to IFA they have now received the relevant documentation from the Northern Ireland authorities and DEFRA.
Henry Burns said it is obvious some commentators do not understand the concept of the label and are intentionally trying to derail what is a practical and legally compliant solution to ensuring our nearest and strongest beef market is available to Irish farmers. He said this label is specifically designed for cattle born in the ROI and exported to Northern Ireland for feeding/slaughter.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said farmers have reacted positively to the progression of this issue and in anticipation of the label being adopted have returned with confidence to the marts and are driving the trade. While secondary processors have accepted and are using the label it is crucial it is adopted by the major multiplies to maximise the outlets for cattle born in the ROI and exported live to Northern Ireland.
He said it is now incumbent on the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland Minister Michelle O Neill to ensure this issue is resolved and the label accepted to protect the current trade and facilitate the further development of this vital competition in the market place for beef cattle.

He said the rise in UK prices must be reflected by the factories in immediate price increases to farmers to start narrowing the excessive gap between Irish and UK prices.
Eddie Downey said after a dreadful year for beef producers, market factors are finally moving in farmers’ favour. In addition, he said cattle supplies are set to tighten by 150,000 head over the next 12 months, due to an increase in live exports and lower registrations in 2013. He said prices are moving with factories having to pay 5c to 10c per kg above quotes prices to get stock this week.
Eddie Downey said prices are going to have to increase significantly to cover the costs of production and leave a margin for farmers. In addition, he said the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney has to get involved centre stage in resolving the issues around the difficulties in the beef sector with the factories.

In an alert to all farmers, Eddie Downey said the beef price situation was totally unacceptable and unless this is addressed by the factories and prices increase in line with market returns, action will be taken.
Following a meeting of the IFA National Livestock Committee in Dublin this week, Eddie Downey said farmers are very clear and determined that beef prices at the factories must rise to fairly reflect the very strong increase in market prices in our largest export market in the UK. “The market situation has changed dramatically in recent weeks with prices in the UK, our main export market, increasing by an additional €100 per head. These price increases have to be reflected in returns to Irish farmers. Irish prices are now below the EU average.”
The IFA President called on the beef processors to reflect the stronger market returns in prices paid to farmers without any further delay.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said livestock farmers are very frustrated with the failure of the Minister of Agriculture Simon Coveney to deal with the important beef issues that have seriously damaged the sector and farm incomes since last January. He said farmers feel let down on the beef specification issues and the Minister failure to insist that the factories implement the Quality Payment System or price grid in a fair way in line with their agreement with suppliers.
Henry Burns said IFA has repeatedly requested Minister Coveney to deal with a number of issues on beef including resolving the problems for the live trade to the North, the need for more competition and transparency in the trade and for increased monitoring and controls on carcase trim, weights and classification for farmers in the factories.
Based on the most recent Bord Bia cattle price data, the price of R3 grade steers at the Irish meat factories was €3.72/kg incl vat for week ending October 4th 2014. The price of R3 grade steers in Great Britain for the same week was the equivalent of €4.75/kg. This amounts to a price difference of over €1/kg or €350 per head on the average animal. Bord Bia data also report R3 male cattle prices across the main EU Continental markets incl vat as follows; Northern Ireland R3 steers €4.52/kg, Italy R3 bulls €4.01/kg, France R3 bulls €3.83/kg, R3 steers €4.04/kg, Spain R3 bulls €3.86/kg, Germany R3 bulls €3.80/kg, R3 steers €4.19/kg."

He said farmer anger with the meat factories has boiled over with the massive €350 per head cattle price gap now opened up with our main export market in the UK.
Eddie Downey said our message to the factories is very clear: “Farmers have had enough and are not prepared to tolerate loss-making prices any longer, especially when markets are returning much higher prices.” The IFA President challenged the factories to explain their failure to pass back recent UK market price increases of over €100 per head.
The IFA President said for the past 12 months, the factories have hammered farmers with loss- making prices and specification cuts that have inflicted serious income damage on producers. “Farmers cannot continue to sell cattle at a loss. Teagasc figures show that on our most efficient farms, producers need a base price of at least €4.00/kg to make a small margin and €4.50/kg to make a return on investment and labour.”
Eddie Downey said farmers are very determined that beef prices at the factories must rise to fairly reflect the very strong increase in UK cattle prices, where Irish beef sales are up 20% this year. Current prices in Britain for R grade steers are running at the equivalent of €4.74/kg incl vat, which is €1/kg higher than the €3.73/kg Irish price.
The IFA President said nobody can explain to farmers why the price increases in the UK, which takes over half of our exports, are not reflected in higher prices to Irish farmers. He added that Irish prices are now also below the EU average. Eddie Downey called on the beef processors to reflect the stronger market returns in prices paid to farmers without any further delay.

Eddie Downey said, “Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney confirmed that he will convene another meeting of the Beef Forum on November 12th and in the interim, he expects significant progress to be made on the market price and specification issues”.
Mr Downey said he made it very clear to the Minister and the factories at the Beef Forum that they must respond to this week’s 24-hour beef protest by addressing the massive €350 per head price gap that has now opened up with our main export market in the UK.
The IFA President said the Minister told members of the Forum that ‘its primary focus was to ensure that farmers get a fair reflection of market returns’.  Bord Bia made a detailed presentation on markets outlining that the price gap between Irish and UK cattle prices has widened to 96c/kg, or €350 per head. Representatives of Tesco and McDonalds, the two largest purchasers of Irish beef, addressed the Beef Forum and confirmed that they had not changed any of their specifications in the last 12 months.
The Minister agreed with IFA that trust had clearly broken down between processors and producers and farmers feel they are not getting a fair deal on price from the factories.
With UK beef prices increasing by 30c/kg (€100 per head) in the last number of weeks, Eddie Downey said there is no excuse for the factories to withhold a price increase to farmers.

Eddie Downey said the situation was extremely tense and farmers across the country are preparing to escalate this dispute with a 48-hour protest next week.
He said, “Real and substantial progress must be made on Friday. Farmers have endured a horrendous year of loss-making cattle prices and unacceptable specification cuts. The meat factory bosses must accept responsibility for their disastrous handling of the relationship with their farmer suppliers this year. Farmer patience with the factories has run out and the industry must address the issues now.”
Eddie Downey said Bord Bia confirmed to the Beef Forum that cattle prices in the UK market have improved by 30c/kg in recent months and this must be reflected in returns to Irish farmers. He said cattle prices in Ireland have improved by 10c/kg over the last week, but this is nowhere near enough to reflect the strong returns in our main export market in the UK.
He said IFA is determined that the increases in market returns are passed back to farmers, and that all of the specification issues, including the QPS, are comprehensively addressed. “Through the Beef Forum, Minister Coveney must put in place the policy and structures that will prevent any recurrence of the issues that have led to the collapse of trust between farmers and factories this year”. He said the Minister made it abundantly clear at the last Beef Forum that ‘the primary focus of the Forum was to ensure that farmers get a fair reflection of market returns’.
As well as the price issues, Henry Burns said IFA will be insisting at Friday’s meeting that the following issues are comprehensively addressed:
– Re-instatement of the Quality Payment System without dual base price cuts for breeds, weights or age;
– No carcase weight limits as part of QPS;
– Increase in the age limit from 30 months to 36 months;
– All animals from a QA farm should receive a bonus payment;
– The number of farm residencies should be increased;
– More contracts and premium payments at viable levels for winter finishers and bull beef producers;
– Full and accurate price transparency in the supply chain, with reporting of wholesale and retail prices, as well as producer prices;
– Clear remittance documents and transparent purchase terms;
The Beef Forum scheduled for next Wednesday must also address the following key issues:
– Re-assurance for farmers with an independent Department inspector in each meat plant to oversee carcase trim, weights and classification, and appeals;
– Removal of the roadblocks impeding the live trade to Northern Ireland & Great Britain;
– Strong support for an active live export trade to instil greater competition in the beef trade;
– Increased support for the suckler cow sector, which is under severe income pressure;
– Strong defence of the Irish and EU beef sector against the threat posed by increased imports under the EU/TTIP and Mercosur trade deals."

He said the meat factories must reflect the higher market returns back to farmers. 
Eddie Downey said farmers will be protesting at meat plants around the country from 3pm on Sunday afternoon for 48 hours.
After over eight hours of discussions on specifications under the chairmanship of Michael Dowling with the meat factories today, Eddie Downey said progress was made, but there are still outstanding issues.
The IFA President was accompanied by the National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns and Deputy President Tim O’Leary as well as other representatives at the meeting.
Eddie Downey said, “Bord Bia confirmed to the Beef Forum that cattle prices in the UK market have improved by 30c/kg in recent months and this must be reflected in returns to Irish farmers. Cattle prices here have improved by 10c/kg over the last week, but this is nowhere near enough the strong returns in our main export market in the UK”.
The IFA President said all of the specification issues, including the QPS and weight limits, and the other issues that have led to the collapse of trust between farmers and factories this year have to be fully addressed.

Eddie Downey said, “IFA’s Executive Council and National Livestock Committee sanctioned further action unless the massive €350 gap between the UK beef prices and ourselves was addressed. The beef processors have to take responsibility for this situation. Even with incontrovertible market evidence that shows how the UK price has moved on by 30c/kg in recent months, they have continued to deny farmers a return that reflects improved market conditions”.
The IFA President said the resolve of farmers heading into the 48-hour protest was very strong. Farmers were assured all year that when market conditions improved, beef prices would move on to reflect this. “Farmers cannot continue to sell cattle at a loss. Teagasc figures show that on our most efficient farms, producers need a base price of at least €4.00/kg.”
Eddie Downey said farmers are very determined that beef prices at the factories must rise to fairly reflect the very strong increase in UK cattle prices, where Irish beef sales are up 20% this year. Current prices in Britain for R grade steers are running at the equivalent of €4.70/kg incl vat, which is almost €1/kg higher than the €3.73/kg Irish price.
Teagasc has confirmed that livestock farm incomes are down 13% to 22% last year, ranging from €9,469 to €15,595.
Eddie Downey said IFA had engaged fully with the Beef Forum process. He said he was confident, based on intensive discussions last week that agreement could be reached on a wide range of issues at the Minister’s Beef Forum next Wednesday. “After over eight hours of discussions under the chairmanship of Michael Dowling with the meat factories on Friday last progress was made on a range of our concerns regarding specifications, but the issue of market price returns is separate to the Forum’s discussions and needs to be progressed by the meat factories immediately.” "
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/new-data-on-beef-consumption-and-retail-price-exposes-processors-on-cattle-price-gap-ifa/,2014-11-10,New Data on Beef Consumption and Retail Price Exposes Processors on Cattle Price Gap – IFA,"New data on beef consumption and retail prices in the UK and Ireland compiled by IFA shows that there is no justification for the meat factories to continue to withhold higher market returns to beef farmers.
IFA President Eddie Downey said the figures illustrate very starkly that our main market in the UK performed strongly on both volume sales and retail price in recent months, which coincided with the 30c/kg increase in UK cattle prices and the widening of the gap between here and the UK to €350 per head.
“For the 12 weeks to the middle of September, the volume of beef sales in the UK was up 4.1%. During the same time period, price rose by 3.3%. Given the large scale of exports to the UK market from here, the processors cannot justify their refusal to pass back increased market prices to Irish farmers.”
Speaking at the ABP plant in Cahir, Co Tipperary as the 48-hour nationwide protest entered its second phase, Eddie Downey said the figures raise serious questions about the margins that operate in the food supply chain outside the farmgate. “The price we are getting has been cut, yet consumers in our main market are paying more. Clearly, this situation is being exploited by processors and retailers at the expense of consumers and primary producers.”
Mr Downey said a key element of addressing the beef price question must be full transparency and independent verification of wholesale and retail prices so that is it clear to everyone who gets what in the food chain. The Bord Bia facts on beef prices are based on the European statutory requirement of price reporting and, coupled with the most recent retail figures, show clearly that there is justification for an increase to producers.
An examination of Irish retail beef prices in the 12 months to August 2014 shows that there is no link between the fall in farm gate prices and the price consumers pay. CSO data reveals that there was a small drop in steak prices of 2%, while other beef products, including diced beef (+6%) and roast beef (+1%) increased in price. Teagasc has confirmed that livestock farm incomes are down 13% to 22% last year, ranging from €9,469 to €15,595. Eddie Downey said the growing divergence between the incomes of beef farmers on the one hand, and the prices that consumers are paying on the other, is evidence of the collusion between processors and retailers to cream off excessive margins for themselves.
Eddie Downey said farmers are very determined that beef prices at the factories must rise to fairly reflect the very strong increase in UK cattle prices, where Irish beef sales are up 20% this year. Current prices in Britain for R grade steers are running at the equivalent of €4.70/kg incl vat, which is almost €1/kg higher than the €3.73/kg Irish price.
Mr Downey said IFA had engaged fully with the Beef Forum process. He said he was confident, based on intensive discussions last week that agreement could be reached on a wide range of issues at the Minister’s Beef Forum next Wednesday. “After over eight hours of discussions under the chairmanship of Michael Dowling with the meat factories on Friday last progress was made on a range of our concerns regarding specifications, but the issue of market price returns is separate.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-determined-that-beef-forum-must-deliver-real-results-for-farmers/,2014-11-12,IFA Determined That Beef Forum Must Deliver Real Results for Farmers,"Ahead of this afternoon’s Beef Forum, IFA President Eddie Downey said farmers were never more united in their determination that Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must deliver real results that will see all of the specification issues fully resolved, and increased market returns passed back to farmers.
Eddie Downey said the message from this week’s 48-hour protest, which was strongly supported by thousands of farmers across the country, cannot be ignored by the Minister and the Forum.
Mr Downey said the behaviour of the meat factories this year on specifications and their dealings with farmers has seriously damaged trust. “The beef protest has sent a clear message to meat factory bosses that farmers must be treated fairly and with respect. At today’s Forum, Minister Coveney must ratify all of the progress made on specifications and terms of trade, and commit that the Forum will guarantee that agreements are honoured in full in the future.”
The IFA President said, “At the last Forum two weeks ago, Minister Coveney was very clear that the primary focus of the Forum was ‘to ensure that farmers get a fair reflection of market returns’”. Eddie Downey said the meat factories must address the €350 per head price gap that has now opened up with our main export market in the UK, where beef prices have increased by over 30c/kg in recent months.
On the specification issues that need to be resolved today, Eddie Downey said IFA is demanding that the factories pay a basic Quality Assured bonus on all cattle from a Bord Bia-approved QA farm. He said Minister Coveney has strongly supported this proposal from the IFA and said it would be dealt with at the Forum.
On the issue of the 30 month age limit, Eddie Downey said more progress must be made. “The proposal from last Friday’s meeting is that the Minister for Agriculture, processors and producers together with Bord Bia, will work over the next six months to pursue the objective of increasing the age limit from 30 to 36 months, taking account of production and market factors. In addition it was also agreed to pursue an increase in the number of farm residencies from four farms and have more flexibility under the 70 days final residencies requirement to accommodate mart sales.”
Eddie Downey said full price transparency right along the beef chain is essential. He said farmer prices and retail prices are openly available, but the missing link is the price that factories sell the product to the retailers and food service customers. He pointed that in the USA, the government legally obliges factories to publish these prices. In addition, he said there can be no confusion on cattle price comparisons between EU member states. He said the Department of Agriculture is legally obliged to use the EU standardised beef price reporting system, where the R3 grade is the agreed norm.
The independent chairman Michael Dowling negotiated agreement with the processors that they will participate in a transparent wholesale price index to be published with Bord Bia and DAFM. It was also agreed that the processors will introduce a transparent remittance document and transparent purchase terms for buying cattle from farmers.
At last Friday’s meeting between IFA and the meat factories, it was agreed that the Quality Payment System will be fully reinstated with a single base price per factory for steers and separately for heifers. “This means that there will be no dual base pricing on breeds, weights or additional price penalties on age as was applied for long periods throughout 2014.” In addition, the in spec bonus will be 12c/kg and operate as originally agreed.
On weights, IFA was very clear that there could be no price cuts. The factories proposed no cuts up to 440kgs. Subsequently, it was agreed that no weight limit cuts would apply for a period of 12 months and the issue and impact of carcase weights, particularly for the suckler herd, would be examined with Teagasc, Bord Bia and ICBF, together with the Department of Agriculture.
On the issue of establishing the number of farm residencies for the payment of the 12c in-spec bonus, it was agreed that the AIMS will be adjusted by the Department of Agriculture and used as the method by all factories to count the number of farm residencies.
Eddie Downey said it was agreed that the processors would operate more contracts for winter finishers and bull beef producers.
The IFA President said Michael Dowling also confirmed that it was also agreed that the processors will support the proposals for independent Department of Agriculture inspectors in each meat plant to oversee carcase trim, weights and mechanical classification, including appeals."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/good-progress-made-by-ifa-at-beef-forum-on-key-specification-issues/,2014-11-13,Good Progress Made by IFA at Beef Forum on Key Specification Issues,"Following a meeting of the Beef Forum last evening (Wed), IFA President Eddie Downey said good progress was made by the IFA on all of the key specification issues including reinstatement of the Quality Payment System, the removal of weight limits and a new Quality Assurance incentive payment for all steers and heifers from Jan 1st 2015.
On the separate issue of cattle prices, Eddie Downey said IFA is determined that prices must move on and that increased market returns are passed back to farmers. He said the thousands of farmers who protested at the factories over the unacceptable €350 price gap with the UK have sent a very strong message that cattle prices must increase. Prices have risen by another 5c/kg this week.
Mr Downey said the behaviour of the meat factories this year on specifications and their dealings with farmers has seriously damaged trust. “The beef protest has sent a clear message to meat factory bosses that farmers must be treated fairly and with respect. At last evening’s Forum, Minister Coveney secured agreement from the meat factories that the specifications issues will be resolved.”
Eddie Downey said the Quality Payment System is fully reinstated with a single base price per factory for steers and separately for heifers. This means no dual base pricing by breed, age, weight or Quality Assurance status.
IFA has secured agreement with Minister Coveney that the factories will introduce a targeted, cost- neutral price incentive for all steers and heifers from Quality Assured farms from Jan 1st 2015.
It has been agreed that processors and Bord Bia will engage with customers, and DAFM will engage with third country markets with a view to increasing the age specification for premium beef from 30 to 36 months of age.
On farm movements, it was agreed that factories will harmonise the system of counting the four farm residencies for paying the QPS in spec bonus and the Department will make the necessary adjustments to the AIMS system for this purpose. In addition, it was also agreed to secure flexibility on the number of movements and length of residency as well as removing the barriers on sale through the marts and ensuring the QPS bonus.
Eddie Downey said full price transparency right along the beef chain is essential. He said it is now agreed that the current statutory price reporting system based on the R3 price is the accepted system of cattle price comparisons across the EU. It has also been agreed to develop a market index with a view to having more transparency in the chain.
It was also agreed that the processors will introduce a transparent remittance document.
On weights, IFA was very clear that there could be no price cuts. It was agreed there will be no price penalties on any animals on weight up to Dec 31st 2015. Teagasc, ICBF and Bord Bia will examine the implications of weight on the suckler herd.
Eddie Downey said it was agreed that the processors would operate more contracts for winter finishers and bull beef producers.
The IFA President said it was also agreed that the Department will strengthen controls on the carcass trim in meat plants in accordance with EU Regulations.
Beef Roundtable Outcomes"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/meat-factories-must-make-signficant-move-on-price-ifa/,2014-11-14,Meat Factories Must Make Signficant Move on Price – IFA,"The Executive Council of the Irish Farmers Association met in Dublin today to consider the outcome of last night’s Beef Forum, and to discuss the next phase of the Association’s campaign to get a price increase for farmers that reflects the higher returns from our main export market in the UK.
IFA President Eddie Downey said the mood among members of the Executive Council was one of deep frustration at the failure of the meat factories to pass back the stronger prices in our main market in the UK to farmers here. “At today’s meeting, our County Chairmen reflected the views of the thousands of farmers who supported our 48-hour protest this week, who are resolute in their determination that factories respond on prices.”
Eddie Downey said the Association’s Executive Board will meet on Saturday to assess the progress made on prices and decide on the next move.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said agents will be setting prices tomorrow for cattle to be delivered next week. He said prices are rising and he advised farmers to demand more and negotiate the full value of their cattle. Henry Burns said farmers are securing 5c-10c over quoted prices in some factories and supplies are extremely tight. Factories are struggling to get numbers for the Christmas kill.
Eddie Downey said the Executive Council was satisfied that significant progress was made by the IFA at the Beef Forum on the specification issues that have bedevilled the relationship between farmers and the meat factories all year. They included issues such as the reinstatement of the Quality Payment System, the removal of weight limits and a new Quality Assurance incentive payment for all steers and heifers from Jan 1st 2015."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-warns-factories-that-upward-cattle-price-movements-must-continue/,2014-11-19,IFA Warns Factories That Upward Cattle Price Movements Must Continue,"IFA President Eddie Downey said cattle prices are rising and he warned the factories that the upward movements must continue to fully reflect the strong increase of over 30c/kg in recent months from our main export market in the UK.
Following a meeting of the IFA Executive Council in Dublin this week, Eddie Downey said the tens of thousands of farmers who took part in the IFA protests have made it abundantly clear that they are not prepared accept loss making cattle prices from the factories when market returns are on the increase. He warned the factories that farmers expect prices to continue to rise and fairly reflect increased market returns.
Eddie Downey said the IFA action has shown the strength of farmers and their determination in forcing the factories to move on both prices and specifications. He said the IFA protests have empowered farmers, who are digging in hard and holding out for higher prices. In addition, he said IFA delegations are meeting factories across the country this week pressing the case for prices to continue rising.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said “The grass cattle are gone and factories are finding it desperately hard to get numbers. Farmers know the numbers are very tight and are holding out for 5c to 10c over quoted prices.”
Henry Burns said in general the factory base quote has moved up to €3.80/kg for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers and factories are having to pay €3.85/3.90 base for steers and €3.90/3.95/kg for heifers. He said some plants have moved the base quote up to over €3.90 for both steers and heifers. He said farmers are holding out for €4.00/kg for bulls with factories paying €3.95/kg.
The IFA Livestock leader said “Christmas market demand is now at peak. Factories need the numbers and will have to pay to get the stock.”
Eddie Downey said IFA has made solid progress across the range of specification issues at the Beef Forum including reinstatement of the Quality Payment System, the removal of weight limits and a new Quality Assurance incentive payment for all steers and heifers from Jan 1st 2015.
He said the Quality Payment System has been fully reinstated with a single base price for each factory separately for steers and heifers. This means no dual base pricing on breeds, weights or age. In addition, it was agreed at the Forum that the 12c/kg in spec bonus will be retained.
Eddie Downey said IFA secured the abolition of any weight penalties on all animals to December 31st 2015 with a full review on the impact of weight on the suckler herd in the interim.
IFA has secured agreement with Minister Coveney that the factories will introduce a targeted, cost- neutral price incentive for all steers and heifers from Quality Assured farms from Jan 1st 2015.
It has been agreed that processors and Bord Bia will engage with customers, and DAFM will engage with third country markets with a view to increasing the age specification for premium beef from 30 to 36 months of age.

https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/ifa-accuses-competition-and-consumer-protection-commission-of-protecting-big-business-at-expense-of-farmers/,2014-11-19,IFA Accuses Competition and Consumer Protection Commission of Protecting Big Business at Expense of Farmers,"At a protest by the IFA Executive Council outside the offices of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in Dublin today (Tuesday), IFA President Eddie Downey said the intervention by the Commission in the beef dispute has greatly angered farmers and convinced them that the Commission is only interested in protecting big business that are denying farmers a fair return from the market.
Eddie Downey said “Farmers have a legitimate right to protest and IFA will continue to assert our right to protest on all issues, whether these are cattle prices at the factories, below-cost selling of potatoes and vegetables by retailers or policy issues at the highest political level.”
The IFA President said the tone and timing of the Commission’s letter and press release have ensured that the newly merged agency has got off to a bad start with farmers, exhibiting precisely the same bias in favour of big business, i.e., retailers and processors that we saw from the outgoing Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.
At a meeting in Dublin today the IFA Executive Council unanimously rejected what farmers see as the Commission’s partisan intervention on the side of the meat factories, at a time when the factories are under unprecedented public scrutiny and pressure over the unjustifiable price gap they have created between Irish and UK cattle prices and their failure to pass back increased market returns to farmers. The IFA President said, “As farmers see it, the Commission is more interested in protecting the factories, than in ensuring any real fairness or genuine price competition in the beef trade for farmers.”
The IFA President said it is a matter of fact that the Commission’s predecessors have a poor record in their dealings with farmers in all sectors, with no action taken to curb the power of retail multiples which are exerting constant downward pressure on farm-gate prices in many cases below the cost of production.
He said the National Consumer Agency clearly supported the race to the bottom on producer prices last Christmas when it welcomed the retailers’ outrageous 5 cent per kilo give-aways of Irish vegetables.
“The NCA couldn’t care less about the vulnerability of the dwindling number of Irish growers at the most important time of their marketing year. Nor did they take any action to protect the interests of consumers and producers in regard to the blatantly misleading labelling of pork and bacon products.”
Eddie Downey said the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has serious questions to answer on their failure to act and investigate the inequity in the food chain and the power of the retailer multiples and big business, and how they use this against farmers and small suppliers.
Why has the Commission not acted to investigate the inequity in the food chain and widening gap between the price the consumer is paying and the price the farmer is getting?
On beef, why has the Competition Commission intervened on the side of the beef factories in a protest by farmers who are only looking for a fair return from the market?
Why hasn’t the Competition Commission investigated why Irish farmers are getting up to €350 per head less for their cattle than their counterparts in the UK?
Why has the Commission not investigated the retailers over the way they forced the collapse of retail prices on vegetables last December?
Eddie Downey said the Competition Authority previously raided farmers in their homes and launched investigations into their representative organisation, but has failed abysmally to direct their investigative resources to probe the activities of big business such as the retail multiples who dominate the supply chain.
The IFA President said in recent months, there has been a deep frustration among farmers at the collective failure of the factories to pass back the stronger prices available in our main export market in the UK to farmers here. He said the price gap with the UK has grown to an unprecedented €350 per head at present, which is four times the average gap over the past ten years of €90 per head. He asked, “Where was the Competition Authority on that imbalance? Why have they made no impact on the anti-competitive structures in fuel and fertilisers, which have resulted in input costs to farmers rising by over 50% since 2005 destroying the viability of many family farmers?”"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-says-cattle-prices-continue-to-rise-as-numbers-tighten/,2014-11-27,IFA Says Cattle Prices Continue to Rise as Numbers Tighten,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said cattle prices are continuing to rise with farmers holding out strongly for higher prices. He said the grass cattle are completely gone and factories are desperately struggling to get numbers this week. A lot of individual deals are being done by different factories to get stock, with paid prices ranging from €3.90 to 3.98/kg base for steers and €3.95 to in excess of €4.00/kg base for heifers. Some factories are doing flat prices ranging from €4.05 to €4.10 for under and over 30 month R grade steers.
Henry Burns said “Factory agents are saying farmers are not prepared to part with cattle unless they can offer a base of €4.00/kg. Agents are also saying they simply can’t get the cattle and the price will have to kick on again”.
The IFA Livestock leader said paid prices are up another 5c/kg this week, despite the quoted price for steers being €3.85 in some places, prices of €3.90 to €3.95 are more freely available and up to €3.98 in places. For heifers the quoted base price of €3.90/kg is failing to buy the numbers of heifers needed, with factories having to pay €3.95 freely and up to €4.00/kg plus to get stock.
Henry Burns said the IFA protests have shown the strength of farmers and their determination to force the factories and the Minister on price and specifications. He said farmers are standing together and are not prepared to accept the quoted prices when they know more is on offer. ”Farmers are digging in hard and holding out for higher prices.”
Henry Burns said IFA will continue to keep the pressure on Minister Coveney to deliver implementation of the specification changes from the Beef Forum. “Farmers expect to see Minister Coveney and the Beef Forum delivering quickly on the key issues of age limits, quality assurance, carcase trim and market transparency.”
Henry Burns said demand in our major export market in the UK is very strong with UK cattle prices continuing to rise. He said UK cattle prices are up 34c/kg since August and while Irish prices have increased 20c to 30c/kg in recent weeks, they have a long way to go to make a greater impact on closing the unprecedented price gap between Ireland and the UK.
The IFA Livestock leader said producers are in a much stronger position to hold out and insist on higher prices, with cattle in sheds at this stage. In addition he said the costs associated with cattle coming out of sheds are so much higher, these producers need to see the price continuing to rise.
Henry Burns said Bord Bia are reporting some seasonal lifts in cattle prices and beef demand in both the UK and across the main European markets. He said Bord Bia report the R3 steer price in Britain at the equivalent of €4.77 incl vat for week ending Nov 16th. In Northern Ireland the R3 steer was making €4.64/kg. Across EU markets R3 steers were making €3.94/kg in France and €4.06/kg in Germany. R3 young bulls are making the equivalent of €3.85 in Italy and Germany."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/demand-for-cattle-strong-ifa/,2014-12-04,Demand for Cattle Strong – IFA,"IFA President Eddie Downey said demand for cattle remains strong with factories paying €4.00/kg base price for heifers and €3.90 to €3.95 base price for steers. He said with the large kills of recent weeks, supplies are expected to tighten sharply.
Eddie Downey said the Christmas market demand for beef, especially in our main market in the UK, is particularly strong, where prices have reached the equivalent of €4.75/kg for R3 grade steers. He said with all of the grass cattle gone at this stage, farmers selling cattle out of sheds need to see prices kick in order to make a margin. A lot of different deals on prices are being done to get cattle, ranging from a base price of €4.00/kg for heifers to an all-in price of €4.10/kg for R grade steers in some outlets.
At a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney in Dublin this week, Eddie Downey said it is vitally important that all of the agreed outcomes from the Minister’s Beef Forum are fully implemented by the factories. Eddie Downey said he raised a number of issues with the Minister where some meat plants have imposed dual base prices around non Quality Assured stock and weight penalties contrary to what was agreed at the Beef Forum. Eddie Downey told the Minister that this is a very serious issue that he must take up with directly with MII and the factories.
Eddie Downey said the Beef Forum outcome is very clear and states “processors agree there will be no dual base pricing for steers or heifers in individual processing plants, by breed, age or weight or Quality Assurance status.” The Beef Forum outcome also states “Processors will agree not to impose any price penalties on any animals based on weight up to 31st December 2015.”
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the Teagasc headline that Beef Farm incomes are down 5% in 2014 completely hides the real income crisis in the livestock sector and conceals the fact that the latest income fall comes on top of cuts in the order of 13% to 22% in 2013, when livestock incomes ranged from €9,469 to €15,595. He said the stark reality of the situation is that most livestock farmers suffered a price cut ranging from €150 to €200 per head on finished cattle all year and lost money."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-coveney-must-ensure-that-all-beef-forum-outcomes-are-fully-implemented/,2014-12-11,Minister Coveney Must Ensure That All Beef Forum Outcomes Are Fully Implemented,"IFA President Eddie Downey has welcomed the statement from Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney that there can be no delay or sidestepping in the implementation of the outcomes from the Beef Forum. He said IFA has made it very clear that the Minister must ensure that all of the agreed outcomes from the beef forum are fully implemented, in line with the timeframes laid down.
Eddie Downey said there is an urgency to progress the issue on the Quality Assurance incentive, which is due to be implemented from January 1st. “ IFA has requested Minister Coveney to get the Department of Agriculture to arrange and chair an immediate meeting in line with the procedure agreed in the Beef Forum on this issue. Both IFA and MII consider it is very important that the Department of Agriculture be involved in this process.”
Eddie Downey said IFA has raised a number of issues with the Minister where individual meat plants have imposed dual base prices around non-Quality Assured stock and weight penalties contrary to what was agreed at the Beef Forum. Eddie Downey told the Minister that this is a very serious issue that he must take up with directly with MII and the factories.
Eddie Downey said the Beef Forum outcome is very clear and states: “processors agree there will be no dual base pricing for steers or heifers in individual processing plants, by breed, age or weight or Quality Assurance status.” The Beef Forum outcome also states: “Processors will agree not to impose any price penalties on any animals based on weight up to 31st December 2015.”
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said cattle prices remain stable with factories paying 5c to 10c over quoted prices. He said the Department of Agriculture reported prices for last week, Dec 7th show the average R3 steer price at €3.94/kg and top prices paid of €4.04/4.05 including bonuses. He said the Department heifer prices show the factories paid an average of €4.07/kg for R3 heifers with top prices including bonuses of €4.19/kg.
Henry Burns said farmers are also negotiating improved deals on over 30 month stock and bulls with flat prices of €3.90 to €4.00/kg being paid."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-welcome-news-on-us-market-for-irish-beef/,2015-01-05,IFA Welcome News on Us Market for Irish Beef,"IFA President Eddie Downey has welcomed the news that the US market has opened to Irish beef exports, saying “This is a positive development and its significance will be judged by farmers securing improved beef prices from the market place in 2015″.
Eddie Downey said the major increase in US beef prices, up by €1/kg in the last year and now at €4.70/€4.80/kg, must present a real opportunity for Irish grass-based beef exports.
The IFA President said Irish cattle prices are rising and combined with much tighter supplies in 2015, price prospects look much more promising for beef farmers.
He said prices have opened stronger with a base of €4.00/kg for steers and €4.05/4.10 base for heifers. He said factories are already finding it difficult to procure tighter supplies and some top prices of €4.20 to €4.40/kg for specialist lots have been paid."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-rising/,2015-01-09,Cattle Prices Rising,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has said cattle prices are continuing to drive on into the new year with prices rising and factories having to pay above quoted prices to get tighter supplies.
He said the base price of steers has moved up to €4.00/kg and for heifers to €4.10/kg. He said more is being paid to get numbers and top prices of €4.20/4.30 paid in order to procure specialist lots over the last few days.
Henry Burns said a large number of plants are very active to purchase bulls ranging from O grade Friesians at €3.90 to R and U grade continentals, making €4.10/kg.
The IFA Livestock leader said cattle supplies have tightened considerably and factories are having to pay higher prices to get stock from feeders. He said agents are finding it very difficult to get numbers and feeders are digging in, insisting on higher prices to cover the extra costs of shed feeding.
Henry Burns said cattle supplies will be very tight this spring with Bord Bia forecasting numbers to be back 150,000 head for 2015. “Tighter supplies will make a big difference and should swing the balance in favour of the feeder selling.”
The IFA Livestock leader said a critical factor for the beef sector going forward is a strong live export trade for dairy calves. He said the decisions farmers make regarding calves from the dairy herd this spring will be crucial in the years ahead. What happens this spring will have a significant impact for farmers selling cattle in two years’ time.
Henry Burns said IFA is very clear that we need to have a strong live export trade for price competition and particularly for male calves from the dairy herd. He said in 2014 the live export trade was strong with total volumes of almost 240,000 head, up 27,000 or 13% on 2013 levels. He said calf exports were strong with almost 40,000 head to Holland, 22,000 to Belgium and 44,000 to Spain. The international live trade was also active with almost 18,000 head exported to Libya. He said there are very strong opportunities for live exports in 2015 and IFA will work hard to drive this and maximise price competition in 2015."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/strong-live-export-trade-essential-for-cattle-price-competition-ifa/,2015-01-15,Strong Live Export Trade Essential for Cattle Price Competition – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said a strong live export trade is essential to maximise price competition and ensure a balance in cattle supplies relative to market demand in order to optimise prices and avoid the marketing problems which occurred in 2014. He said this is more important than ever, given the expansion of the dairy herd and the requirement to find a suitable market outlet for male calves, particularly considering the bull beef problems in 2014.
Henry Burns said IFA is very clear on the need to have a strong live export trade. He said a critical factor for the beef sector is a strong live export trade for dairy calves. “The decisions farmers make regarding calves from the dairy herd this spring will be crucial in the years’ ahead. What happens this spring will have a significant impact for farmers selling cattle in two years’ time.”
Henry Burns said there are very strong opportunities for live exports in 2015 and IFA will work hard to drive this and maximise price competition. Reduced milk powder costs should drive a strong demand from the veal calf market in Europe. In addition, three specialist boats have now been passed for international live exports and another boat is expected to be cleared very soon. This is very positive for the live trade for cattle to North Africa. Another positive factor is the reopening of the live trade to Turkey with recent shipments from France.
The IFA Livestock leader said a strong live trade will require a clear Government commitment and strong support from Minister Coveney and the Department of Agriculture. “Minister Coveney must continue the work with retailers and others to remove the artificial barriers around labelling impeding the live trade to Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”
Henry Burns said IFA worked hard to drive on the live trade in 2014 with an increase in numbers exported of 25,000 head to 237,000 head, including 52,000 to Northern Ireland. IFA secured the reopening of the Stena ferry route to Britain with live exports increasing by 61% to 18,000 head for the year. In addition, over 17,000 head were also exported to Libya in 2014, after being closed for 16 years. IFA worked closely with shippers, exporters and the DAFM to secure veterinary certificates and new vessels. He said calf exports were strong with 38,000 head to Holland, 22,000 to Belgium and 44,000 to Spain. 30,000 weanlings were exported to Italy.
Henry Burns said cattle supplies will be very tight this spring with Bord Bia forecasting numbers to be back 150,000 head for 2015. “Tighter supplies will make a big difference in 2015 and should swing the balance in favour of the farmers selling cattle. This is a direct result of an increase in live exports in 2013 and a reduction in calf registrations.”
The IFA Livestock leader said security of payment is a crucial issue for farmers selling cattle. He said farmers should cattle in their local livestock mart where payment is guaranteed and in all other cases insist on payment on the day.
Henry Burns said cattle prices are continuing to drive on in the New Year with prices rising and factories having to pay above quoted prices to get tighter supplies. He said the base price of steers is €4.00/4.05 with tops of €4.10/kg paid and for heifers to €4.10/kg with top prices of €4.20/kg paid."

Henry Burns said at the next Forum meeting, Minister Coveney will have to tackle the factories over their commitment to Quality Assurance considering their reluctance to pay a worthwhile incentive for steer and heifers from quality assured farms, as agreed at the Forum meeting in November. He said Minister Coveney and the DAFM have to get fully engaged and take a more hands on approach to ensuring that the Forum outcomes are properly implemented.
Henry Burns said IFA will be insisting that progress is made across the large range of issues agreed at the last Forum including the proper and fair operation of the QPS, removal of severe specifications cuts and replacing them with conditions that suit Irish beef production on weight, age, residency and movements, proper price transparency through a market index, more contracts, opening live exports markets, increased monitoring of carcase trim by the DAFM and a clear market and production plan for bulls.
The IFA Livestock leader said the increase in cattle prices since the IFA protest is positive and prices need to continue to move forward for winter finishers. He said the increase in prices and removal of specification cuts on weight and age since the IFA protests goes to prove how wrong last year’s severe specification cuts from the factories were."

The next Beef Forum is set to take place on February 4th. Minister Coveney told the IFA AGM he will continue to chair the Forum and will be taking a tough line on implementation of the agreement reached at the last meeting in November, at the time of the IFA factory protests.
Henry Burns said serious lessons must be learned from last year where the factories and retailers took full advantage of the 150,000 head increase in cattle numbers and played havoc with prices and specifications. He said a strong live export trade is crucial to maximise price competition and to avoid a repeat of the marketing problems that damaged livestock farmers’ incomes in 2014.
Minister Coveney said a strong and active live trade is essential for the beef trade and to keep the factories honest. He said he will fully facilitate the live trade and sees it as a priority for the sector. The Minister told the IFA AGM that farmers need to be treated in fairer and a more transparent way as regards beef market returns.
Henry Burns told Minister Coveney that Beef Forum must deliver on full market price transparency, more competition and that the factories must fairly pass back market returns in cattle prices back to farmers. He said the age limit must be lifted from 30 to 36 months as set down in the forum. In addition, he said the Department of Agriculture must increase the level of checks on carcase trim in each meat plan as agreed at the Forum and the AIMS system for counting the number of farm residencies must be changed. He said at the next forum meeting, Minister Coveney must challenge the factories on their less than honest effort to introduce a worthwhile incentive on steers and heifers from quality assurance farms.
Minister Coveney told the IFA AGM that he believes 2015 will be a much better year for beef with better market returns and tighter supplies. He said the opening of the US beef market will be very significant for Ireland. Henry Burns said supplies are forecast to be back by up to 150,000 head this year. “This will tilt the market balance in favour of the farmer and drive on prices. Winter finishers need to see prices continue to improve.”
Henry Burns said a major IFA campaign on suckler support secured an increase in the Beef Genomic Scheme to €100 per head for the first 10 cows and €80 per head on the remainder, worth €52m. He said IFA is very clear that all sucklers applied for must be paid on. The IFA Livestock leader said strong direct supports are essential to maintain the national suckler herd and IFA will push for a higher payment per cow in the order of €200."

He said progress has been made across a number of issues on specifications and prices are moving in the right direction, but there is a lot more work to be done.
Eddie Downey said key issues for the Forum will be an update on the progress on beef price transparency; movement on the age issue from 30 to 36 months; Quality Assurance; and bull beef production.

Eddie Downey said progress has been made across a number of issues on specifications, and prices are moving in the right direction, but there is a lot more work to be done.
Eddie Downey said IFA raised the following key issues at the Forum meeting:
• Movement on the age limit from 30 to 36 months;
• Quality Assurance;
• Market price transparency;
• Bull beef production;
• Movement and residency issues;
• Carcase trim
• Live exports; and,
• Contracts.
Minister Coveney told the Forum that Bord Bia and the factories are making progress on the market price transparency index. He said that Bord Bia, Teagasc and ICBF are working on the age and weight issues. It was agreed that the Department of Agriculture will make the necessary changes to the AIMS database to clarify any confusion on counting the number of farm residencies.

There was a full presentation from Bord Bia on market prospects and bull beef production together with Teagasc. Minister Coveney concluded that cattle supplies will be back by 120,000 – 150,000 head in 2015, exchanges rates are much more positive and prices are increasing.
On bulls, it was agreed to set up a sub-committee to look at various production systems and specifications. Teagasc presented data showing that the most efficient farmers need beef prices in the range of €4.00 – €4.50/kg across the different bull beef systems. Teagasc made it very clear that under 16-month bull beef based on male HF calves from the dairy herd is uneconomic.
Eddie Downey and Henry Burns are part of an IFA delegation currently visiting Washington DC, following the opening of the US market to Irish beef exports.
Eddie Downey said the opening of the US market is a positive development and its significance will be judged by farmers securing improved beef prices from the marketplace in 2015.
He said the major increase in US beef prices, up by €1/kg in the last year and now at €5.00-€5.15/kg, must present a real opportunity for Irish grass-based beef exports. He said Minister Coveney has indicated that the US market could take up to 20,000t of Irish beef in 2015 and this would be substantial."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/branding-opportunity-for-irish-beef-in-the-us-market-ifa/,2015-02-12,Branding Opportunity for Irish Beef in the Us Market – IFA,"Speaking from the United States this week, IFA President Eddie Downey said that Ireland should take the opportunity to clearly brand Irish beef in the US market. He said this presented the best chance to establish a premium price and long-term brand positioning, especially on retailer shelves.
Eddie Downey and IFA Livestock Chairman Henry Burns participated in an Irish trade mission to the US this week with the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney and Bord Bia to launch Irish beef in the huge US market.
Mr. Downey said the re-opening of the US market sent a very strong and positive message to key US purchasers and potential customers for our beef. However, a number of important issues around quotas, tariffs and end use, which could limit access, would have to be resolved.
At meetings with key organisations in Washington, including the influential Cattlemen’s Association, Henry Burns said that European farmers would be insisting on clear equivalence of standards in any TTIP trade deal between the EU and the US. In comparing positions, it was very clear that the US had their own concerns with TTIP and a deal was far from being concluded.
The Cattlemen’s Association briefed the IFA delegation on the scale of US beef industry, which has 11 million tonnes in beef sales annually, exports in excess of $7 billion and imports in excess of $1 billion mainly from Canada, Mexico and the Uruguay. He said that while US beef producers were struggling to rebuild their beef herd following years of drought, they were benefitting from record prices that now are significantly ahead of European prices.
While the main US beef production states such as Texas were starting to recover from years of drought, the age profile of producers meant that recovery of US beef output would be slow. However, the US has compensated for the reduced production levels by gradually increasing beef carcase weights. In addition, dairy farmers were also taking advantage of very strong cull cow prices by increasing their herd replacement rates."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/strong-live-export-trade-essential-for-price-competition-and-market-balance-ifa/,2015-02-20,Strong Live Export Trade Essential for Price Competition and Market Balance – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has repeated his warning on the need for a strong live export trade, especially for male calves from the dairy herd, to maximise cattle price competition and ensure a balance in future supplies in order to prevent a repeat of the severe problems that occurred in 2014.
Henry Burns said IFA is very clear that a critical factor for the beef sector is a strong live export trade including for dairy calves. “The decisions farmers make regarding calves from the dairy herd this spring will be crucial in the years’ ahead. What happens this spring will have a significant impact for farmers selling cattle in two years’ time.”
Henry Burns said IFA raised this issue at the last Beef Forum meeting in early February and the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney accepted that the live trade was essential for the beef sector in terms of competition and market balance. The IFA Livestock Leader said “Farmers need to do the figures taking account of calf prices, production costs and beef prices. In addition they should talk to their beef processors on contract price arrangements for 2 years’ time before exposing themselves financially to avoid a repeat of the difficulties in 2014.”
Mr Burns said there are very strong opportunities for live exports in 2015 and IFA will work hard to drive this and maximise price competition. Reduced milk powder costs should drive a strong demand from the veal calf market in Europe. In addition, three specialist boats have now been passed for international live exports and another boat is expected to be cleared very soon. This is positive for the live trade for cattle to North Africa. Another positive factor is the reopening of the live trade to Turkey with recent shipments from France.
The IFA Livestock leader said a strong live trade will require a clear Government commitment and strong support from Minister Coveney and the Department of Agriculture. “Minister Coveney must continue the work with retailers and others to remove the artificial barriers around labelling impeding the live trade to Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”
Henry Burns said IFA worked hard to drive on the live trade in 2014 with an increase in numbers exported of 25,000 head to 237,000 head, including 52,000 to Northern Ireland. IFA secured the reopening of the Stena ferry route to Britain with live exports increasing by 61% to 18,000 head for the year. In addition, over 17,000 head were also exported to Libya in 2014, after being closed for 16 years. IFA worked closely with shippers, exporters and the DAFM to secure veterinary certificates and new vessels. He said calf exports were strong with 38,000 head to Holland, 22,000 to Belgium and 44,000 to Spain. 30,000 weanlings were exported to Italy."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/feeders-digging-in-against-factory-pressure-ifa/,2015-03-09,Feeders Digging in Against Factory Pressure – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said farmers are digging in hard and fighting back against pressure from the meat factories. He said feeders are not prepared to part with cattle at the lower quoted base prices of €4.10 on steers and €4.15 on heifers. “Over the weekend factories had to part with €4.15 base to get steers and €4.20 on heifers.” He said farmers should hold out strongly against the factories and insist on the full value for their stock.
Henry Burns said against a backdrop where cattle supplies in 2015 will be back 120/150,000 head, feeders know that supplies are going to get tighter and they need to dig in hard on price and resist the factory pressure.
Henry Burns said the live export trade is increasing rapidly with a total of 7,241 head exported in the week ending March 1st. He said calf exports have increased significantly in the last week, accounting for over 66% or 4,822 head. Exports of adult cattle totalled 1,743 head last week with weanlings and stores totalling 326 and 350 head respectively.
Henry Burns said there were 2,724 head of calves exported to the Netherlands and 1,440 head to Spain. 1,640 cattle went to Northern Ireland, 642 to France, 351 to Britain, 212 head to Italy, 166 to Tunisia and 66 to Germany. Live Exports in the earlier weeks also included 976 head exported to Tunisia, along with 433 to Libya.
Henry Burns said exporters and shippers are working on the trade to North Africa and IFA is hopeful of positive developments over the next number of weeks.
The IFA Livestock leader said there are some more encouraging signs that the EU live trade to Turkey could re-emerge strongly with about 40,000 head of younger stock exported in the last 3 months. In addition there are talks that the live trade for finished cattle to Turkey may reopen soon. He said this could be a major boost for the bull trade in France and Germany.
On beef prices, Henry Burns said any slight weakness in the UK market has been more than compensated for by the continuing strength of sterling against the Euro. He said the change in sterling from 80p to 72.5p against the Euro is worth an additional 52c/kg in returns from GB or about €187 per head.
Henry Burns said market prices across the UK and the EU remain firm, with the British price at the equivalent of €5.34/kg for an R4L steer incl. of vat. Up the road in Northern Ireland, Henry Burns said R3 steers are making the equivalent of €5.15/kg incl. vat. Prices have improved in Italy, with Bord Bia reporting R3 bulls up another 5c/kg to €4.10/kg incl. vat. In Germany, R3 bulls are making €4.23/kg including vat.
The IFA Livestock Leader said cow prices remain very firm reflecting the overall strength of the market. Cows are ranging from €3.40/3.50 for P grades to €3.90/4.00 for U grades."

He said factories were finding it much harder to get tighter supplies and having to pay at least 5c/kg above the quoted prices. “Factories are paying €4.15/kg base to get steers and €4.20 to €4.25/kg base to get heifers. Feeders are not prepared to part with cattle at the lower quoted base prices.”
Henry Burns said farmers should hold out strongly and insist on higher prices over and above the quotes on offer. He said having gone through several months of expensive feeding, farmers should insist on the full value for their stock.
Henry Burns said against a backdrop where cattle supplies in 2015 will be back 120/150,000 head, feeders know that supplies are going to get tighter and they need to dig in hard on price with the factories.
The IFA Livestock leader said, based on the official prices from Department of Agriculture, it is clear that prices are holding up well over the last few weeks despite the negative propaganda from the factories. He said the official R=3= steer price for week ending March 8th was €4.21/kg, which was back just 1c/kg on the previous week. The official R=3= heifer price paid for w/e March 3rd was €4.33/kg. For bulls, the Department figures show the factories paid an average of €4.25 for Us, €4.13 for Rs and €3.95/kg for 0s.
Henry Burns said the live export trade is increasing rapidly with a total of 7,241 head exported in the week ending March 1st.

Exports of adult cattle totalled 1,743 head last week with weanlings and stores totalling 326 and 350 head respectively.
Henry Burns said IFA is working hard on live exports, with a delegation from Holland in the country later this week. In addition, he said exporters and shippers are working on the trade to North Africa and IFA is hopeful of positive developments over the next number of weeks.
The IFA Livestock leader said there are more encouraging signs that the EU live trade to Turkey could re-emerge strongly with about 40,000 head of younger stock exported in the last 3 months.

On market beef prices, Henry Burns said any slight weakness in the UK market has been more than compensated for by the continuing strength of sterling against the €uro. He said the change in sterling from 80p to 72.5p against the €uro is worth an additional 52c/kg in returns from GB or about €187 per head.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-work-on-the-live-trade-strong-calf-exports/,2015-03-20,IFA Work on the Live Trade – Strong Calf Exports,"With live exports reaching almost 12,000 head for the first week in March, IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said these are the key weeks when we must maximise calf exports.
He said “strong live exports are essential to keep competition in the beef trade in the years ahead. We know this only too well from last year, when calf exports fell off in 2012 and extra numbers came through as beef in 2014, causing real prices and specifications problems”.
Henry Burns said last week the IFA and Bord Bia had a group of veal farmers from the LTO in the Netherlands visiting Ireland. “Between them, the group purchase about 30,000 calves per anum and were very impressed with what they saw in Ireland.”
Henry Burns said live exports are very strong at the moment with over 9,000 calves per week. He said in the first week of March, 77% of all exports were calves with 5,694 calves going to the Netherlands and 2,689 calves to Spain.
In addition, 1,648 cattle were exported to Northern Ireland, 631 to France, 429 to Italy, 379 to Britain, 160 to Germany and 37 to Belgium. Henry Burns said to date this year live exports are running very close to 2013 and 2014 levels, which is positive.
Henry Burns said IFA, exporters and shippers are working on the trade to North Africa and IFA is hopeful of positive developments. He said there are also more encouraging signs that the EU live trade to Turkey could re-emerge strongly with about 40,000 head of younger stock exported in the last 3 months. In addition there are talks that the live trade for finished cattle to Turkey may reopen soon. He said this could be a major boost for the bull trade in France and Germany. In addition, almost 6,500 head of cattle were exported from Spain to Libya and the Lebanon from Spain in January.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said cattle prices are improving this week driven by tighter supplies and the continuing strength of sterling. He said a base price of €4.15/kg for steers and €4.25/kg for heifers are more common this week and factories are finding it much harder to get numbers at the lower quoted prices. He said “Farmers with in spec underage cattle should dig in hard and demand 5 to 10c/kg over the quoted base prices”."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-improving-ifa/,2015-04-02,Cattle Prices Improving – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said cattle prices are improving with more feeders getting a base of €4.20/kg on steers and €4.30 base on heifers. He said numbers have tightened again this week and feeders who are digging in hard and holding out are getting the reward.
Henry Burns said factories are finding it a lot more difficult to get stock this week and having to offer well over quoted prices to get the volume. He said feeders are moving agents off the €4.15 base on steers and the €4.25 base on heifers.
The IFA Livestock leader said bulls are making €4.10 for Rs and €4.20 for Us with €4.25/kg paid in places. He said cows continue a good trade ranging from €3.40 to €4.00 tops. He said good R grade cows are making a top price of €3.90/kg.
Henry Burns said cattle price prospects for 2015 are much more positive based on tighter supplies of 150,000 head, strong UK market returns and a continuing strong sterling exchange rate.
Henry Burns said tighter supplies should tip the supply/demand balance firmly in favour of farmers and strengthen their selling power. With sterling at the low 70’s against the Euro and strong UK prices, Irish factories should be able to return viable prices to farmers throughout 2015. IFA provide weekly price updates on the iFarm app.
Henry Burns said the live export trade is crucial for price competition and keeping a balance in supplies. He said IFA has worked hard on an active live trade for dairy calves this spring to avoid a repeat of 2014 problems in 2016/17. “Farmers need to do their figures taking account of the price of calves, beef prices and production costs. They should talk to the factories and see will they commit on beef prices for 2 years’ time.”
IFA is very determined that Minister Coveney delivers on the full implementation of the Beef Forum. “We must have strong delivery on the issues that will make a difference for farmers” according to Henry Burns. On the 30-month age limit, he said there is no scientific basis for this. The vast majority of the key retail and food service customers of Irish beef have no issue with 36 months. The factories unfairly use the age limit against farmers in the autumn and it must be changed.
On specifications, Henry Burns said in Ireland we have to maximise grass based production and our competitive advantage. “All our marketing, including Origin Green, is based on grass. We can’t ask farmers to produce to specs which can’t be achieved off grass.” Henry Burns said we would be mad to go down a road of one spec fits all. In the beef forum, weight limits and price cuts are parked up at least until Jan 2015. He said weight limits are a major issue for the suckler herd.
The IFA Livestock leader said farm movements and residency are critically important for the mart trade. The Department has agreed to change the way the AIMS system records the number of farm residencies for the in spec bonus. He said an animal that spends his life on a Quality Assured farm should not lose his QA status just because he is sold through a mart.
Henry Burns said in the Beef forum, IFA made a genuine move to ensure every animal from a quality assured farm receives a QA price payment. The response from the factories of €3 per head is not seen as serious or genuine. He said Minister Coveney has demanded the meat factories relook at this.
IFA is very determined to make progress on carcase trim from the Beef Forum. The Department Agricultural Officers in the meat plants must be responsible for the daily monitoring of the trim. In addition, the grading needs to be more transparent and it is unacceptable that farmers have no recourse to an appeal under mechanical classification.
The IFA Livestock leader said our suckler cow herd is the backbone of our beef sector. The new €100/80 per cow beef genomics scheme is very positive and needs to open without any further delay. He said IFA is proposing that direct payments should be increased to €200 per head in order to maintain the suckler herd."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-meets-top-department-veterinary-team-on-the-removal-of-bse-restrictions-and-increasing-the-30-month-age-limit-on-prime-beef/,2015-04-17,IFA Meets Top Department Veterinary Team on the Removal of Bse Restrictions and Increasing the 30-month Age Limit on Prime Beef,"IFA President Eddie Downey said there is no scientific reason why a restrictive 30-month age limit on prime cattle should continue to be applied in the Irish beef sector.
Eddie Downey was speaking following a meeting between an IFA livestock and sheep delegation and senior veterinary officials in the Department of Agriculture, including the Chief Veterinary officer.
Eddie Downey said Ireland will move to a “negligible risk” BSE status from May this year following a meeting of the OIE (International Veterinary Authority). He said, “This is a very significant milestone and will close off an extremely difficult chapter on BSE, which arose in the 1990s. It should also open a new era of increased access to international markets and reduced costs, which in turn should deliver increased opportunities and prices for Irish beef farmers”.
As part of the IFA campaign to increase the age limit on prime cattle from 30 to 36 months, Eddie Downey said that with the change in our BSE status from May, processors, retailers and Bord Bia need to work together to deliver on this important outcome of the Beef Forum. He said the delivery target set by Minister Coveney as Chairman of the Beef Forum is that there will be no 30-month age limit applied in summer 2015.
Eddie Downey said Bord Bia have outlined that the vast majority of Ireland’s 80 plus top retail and food service customers do not have a 30-month age requirement. He said “There is now no scientific or market roadblock to increasing the 30-month age limit to 36 months and we must see delivery.”
Eddie Downey said the change in our BSE status and the recommended changes by the European Food Safety Authority to reduce SRM (Specified Risk Material) should result in significant savings in disposal costs for processors, which in turn will also add to the value of the carcase and cattle prices to producers.
The Department officials provided IFA with an update on the progress being made in opening a number of key international markets for beef including access for manufacturing beef to the USA and full access to China. In addition, sheep meat access to the USA and China were also discussed at the meeting. IFA also pushed the need to secure live export access to a number of markets including Turkey for cattle.
Eddie Downey said the positive progress made on market access is very welcome and ultimately farmers will measure this when they see the benefits in terms of increased exports and prices for their stock. IFA also discussed the difficulties with the TB eradication programme with the Department and highlighted that controls and restrictions that do not contribute to eradication but only add costs to farmers must be removed."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-finishers-determined-to-dig-in-on-cattle-prices-ifa/,2015-05-07,Beef Finishers Determined to Dig in on Cattle Prices – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said cattle finishers cannot afford to part with cattle at anything less than last week base prices of €4.20 for steers and €4.30 for heifers. He said the move by some factories to lower quotes is designed to destabilise the trade when numbers are tightening and all they are trying is to get another week’s supply at lower prices.
Henry Burns said after feeding cattle through an expensive winter, feeders are determined to hold off against any negative factory pressure on price. He said finishers are prepared to dig in and not part with stock at less than full value.
Henry Burns said the latest AIMS data from April 1st shows the number of cattle aged between 12 and 36 months are down 181,000 head compared to the same period last year. This clearly confirms that the volume of finished cattle will tighten rapidly in the weeks ahead and should be back by 120/150,000 head over the next 12 months.
In addition, Henry Burns said UK prices remain relatively strong with EBLEX reporting the R4L price at £346.80 for April 25th. He said this is equivalent to €5.07/kg and compares to our average R3 price of €4.28/kg for the same week. This is a price difference of 79c/kg or €276 per head between the Irish price and the price in our largest export market.
On live exports, Henry Burns said over 91,000 head have been live exported so far this year. He said calf exports are back only 10,000 head on last year at just over 61,000. In the last week exports totalled 6,189, of which 4,239 were calves."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/improved-farm-profitability-key-to-strong-livestock-sector-ifa/,2015-05-27,Improved Farm Profitability Key to Strong Livestock Sector – IFA,"Speaking at the launch of the AIB Beef Report this evening, IFA President Eddie Downey said IFA’s main message is very clear: improving profitability at farm level will be key to a strong future for the livestock sector.
Eddie Downey said, “We have made this the core message of our submission and work on the Government’s new Agri-Strategy 2025. Increased profitability at farm level and increased price premium for sustainably-produced Irish food are the two clear targets IFA has set down”.
He said the overarching target for beef must be to improve the viability of cattle enterprises, through a combination of strong viable beef prices, solid direct payment support, increased efficiency and productivity across the sector and co-operation within the sector to optimise the supply balance.
On the Beef Forum, Eddie Downey said that IFA is determined that further progress must be made on increasing the age limit to 36 months, the further development of contracts, and other issues including carcase trim, price transparency and producer organisations.
The new BTAP scheme should target an increase in the number of participating beef farmers from 5,000 to 15,000. It is critically important that Teagasc provides strong, independent research and advisory programmes on beef, which are not influenced by external, commercial bodies. Beef research and advisory services must deliver outcomes that can be easily accessed by farmers and incorporated into their farm enterprises.
The IFA President said farmers will play their part through increasing efficiency and productivity, but it is essential that other stakeholders in the agri-food industry take responsibility for delivering measures that will underpin the long-term income sustainability of primary food production. This must include addressing the imbalances of power in the food supply chain through regulation of trading practices and greater price transparency.
The opening of the US beef market and the progress made on China are positive developments for the beef sector. “The TTIP trade negotiations with the US and the potential for increased imports place the EU beef sector and particularly Ireland, as a major exporter, in a very challenging position. IFA will continue to robustly defend the beef sector based on protecting the European production base and insisting on equivalence of standards”.
Eddie Downey said livestock farming is capital intensive, requiring ongoing investment on-farm to improve efficiency and adapt to new technologies. “Competitive funding from the banks is essential for the sector. IFA will continue to work closely with AIB to ensure that adequate funding is available to meet the needs of farmers and the sector.”
This survey shows that over one third of livestock farmers are planning to increase stock numbers and expand. 43% of farmers are working with an advisor/consultant to improve their businesses. Nine out of 10 beef finishers are in the Bord Bia Quality Assurance scheme. Discussion groups and learning from others is considered very valuable by many respondents.
Concluding, Eddie Downey said these are encouraging and positive messages from livestock farmers working in a sector where the income challenge remains acute. IFA will continue to campaign and work hard both at home and in Brussels to drive delivery on all of the key issues from strong prices and market returns to securing a policy framework that maximises direct supports.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/oie-decision-on-bse-status-welcome-ifa/,2015-06-04,Oie Decision on Bse Status Welcome – IFA,"IFA President Eddie Downey has welcomed the OIE decision to recognise Ireland as a country of ‘negligible risk’ BSE status. “This is a very significant milestone and will close off an extremely difficult chapter on BSE, which arose in the 1990s and caused severe financial and psychological difficulties for farmers and their families. The country’s new status is recognition of the commitment of farmers to achieving the highest herd health standard”.
Eddie Downey said the decision should also open a new era of increased access to international markets and reduced costs, which in turn should deliver increased opportunities and prices for Irish beef farmers.
As part of the IFA campaign to increase the age limit on prime cattle from 30 to 36 months, Eddie Downey said with the change in our BSE status, processors, retailers and Bord Bia need to work together to deliver on this important outcome of the Beef Forum. He said the delivery target set by Minister Coveney as chairman of the Beef Forum is that there will be no 30-month age limit applied in summer 2015.
Eddie Downey said Bord Bia have outlined that the vast majority of Irelands 80 plus top retail and food service customers do not have a 30-month age requirement. He said “There is now no scientific or market roadblock to increasing the 30 month age limit to 36 months and we must see delivery.”
The IFA President said the change in our BSE status and the recommended changes by the European Food Safety Authority to reduce SRM (Specified Risk Material) should result in significant savings in disposal costs for processors, which in turn will also add to the value of the carcase and cattle prices to producers."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-calls-for-beef-forum-meeting/,2015-06-18,IFA Calls for Beef Forum Meeting,"IFA Livestock Chairman, Henry Burns has called on the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney to immediately convene a meeting of the Beef Forum to access progress on implementation and to take stock of the recent developments in the beef sector.
Henry Burns said the last Beef Forum was in February and it is now time Minister Coveney called another meeting to progress issues. He said the Minister, as well as Bord Bia, Teagasc and the meat processors, needs to report on the progress being made on all of the issues including price transparency, specifications, production systems, bulls, quality assurance, weight, age, carcase trim, movement and residency, contracts and live exports.
Henry Burns said Minister Coveney has indicated that a lot of work has being done and progress is being made on a number of issues.
Cattle trade this week
Henry Burns has said the cattle trade has remained very solid this week with factories very anxious for extremely tight supplies. He said the base price for steers has increased with €4.30/kg being paid and the base price for heifers has moved up to €4.40/kg.
He said the general run of prices was a base of €4.25/4.30 for steers and €4.35/4.40 for heifers. He said young bulls are making from €4.10/4.15 for Os, €4.25/4.30 for Rs and €4.35+ for Us. Cow are also in very strong demand with prices are ranging from €3.70 to €4.15/kg."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-stronger-ifa/,2015-06-25,Beef Prices Stronger – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has said the cattle trade is stronger this week, driven by extremely tight supplies and factories not being able to get numbers; a big jump in cattle prices in Britain and Northern Ireland; and, farmers demanding more.
He said steers are making a base price of €4.30 and heifers are on €4.40/kg. Individual deals for full loads are negotiating higher prices. Bulls are also in strong demand with full loads of R and U grades making up to €4.40/kg.
In Britain, Henry Burns said there was a big increase in prices with steers and heifers up 4p to 6p/kg last week. Bulls were also up 8p/kg. He said R4L steers were making £3.43/kg, equivalent to €5.00/kg.
He said the view in Britain is prices have turned a real corner and will strengthen for the remainder of the year. In Northern Ireland the LMC are reporting prices up 14 to 15p/kg in the last week, which is an increase of over 20c/kg.

These include the opening of new markets to deal with increasing cattle numbers, improved carcase classification and trim controls at the meat plants, the implementation of price transparency, adjustments to the AIMS system to properly count farm residencies, Quality Assurance, live exports and specifications which suit Irish production.
Henry Burns said the Beef Forum has proved to be very important in the recovery of the sector and cattle prices from the severe problems experienced throughout 2014. He said through the Forum, IFA has insisted that the Quality Payment System has operated properly with no dual base pricing by the factories and no cuts on breed, age weight or QA status.
The IFA Livestock leader said all projections indicate that finished cattle supplies will remain tight for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016, with Bord Bia forecasting 100,000 head reduction in supplies at the factories. He said that 2015 calvings and registrations have increased and live exports are back, which mean that cattle supplies in 2017 will be higher. He said “The sector, led by the Minister, must act on this now and not wait for another problem in 2017”.
Henry Burns said Minister Coveney has to deliver for real on opening up new markets. He said it is clear there will be increased beef supplies in 2016/17 and we know from 2014 the industry cannot sell additional beef at viable cattle prices. “The Minister must get beef exports moving to the likes of the US and China. We have had all the announcements, but progress on getting exports moving is far too slow.”
The IFA Livestock leader said cattle prices are stronger this week with very strong demand and tighter supplies. He said the base price on steers is €4.30/kg with some factories offering €4.33 to €4.35 to get numbers. On heifers, he said the base price is €4.40, again with some factories offering more to get very scarce supplies. Bulls have also driven on in price with €4.35/4.40 being paid for R/U grades. Cows are also in strong demand with P and O grade making 380 and better quality O grades making €395, and Rs and U grades €410/415/kg.
Henry Burns said IFA met with the NFU Livestock representatives in Brussels last week and they are reporting supplies staying very tight for the rest of the year and a stronger trade. He said cattle prices in Britain continued to increase up another 5p to 6p/kg for week ending June 27th. R grade steers have now moved up to 353.6p/kg, which is equivalent to €5.15/kg incl vat.
He said the continuing strength of sterling is leaving returns from our main export market in the UK very positive.
The IFA Livestock leader said factory agents are actively ringing farmers looking for stock. He said any attempts to buy cattle at lower quoted prices have failed over the weekend and there is now an acceptance they are going to have to pay more. In addition, they are moving outside their usual catchment areas to get numbers."

IFA has written to the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney in advance of the meeting to set out the issues, including the opening of new markets to deal with increasing cattle numbers, improved carcase classification and trim controls at the meat plants, the implementation of price transparency, adjustments to the AIMS system to properly count farm residencies, Quality Assurance, live exports and specifications which suit Irish production.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-says-very-fine-line-balance-on-cattle-supplies-and-prices/,2015-08-07,IFA Says Very Fine Line Balance on Cattle Supplies and Prices,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has said the factories have tried to destabilise the market and frighten farmers into selling cattle at lower quoted prices. However, he added that despite the propaganda from the meat plants, cattle supplies remain very tight and some plants are having to pay a base of €4.20/kg for steers and €4.30 base for heifers to get numbers. In addition, he said these same factories were very anxious to get cattle with immediate delivery.
Henry Burns said at the moment there is a very fine line in the balance between supply and demand, and it is clear that supplies will remain tight over the coming weeks and months. He said the facts from the latest Department AIMS data for June 1st, as presented by Bord Bia, are that there are 100,000 fewer cattle in the 12 to 36 month old age bracket, compared to this time last year. This will leave finished cattle supplies tight for the rest of 2015 and into 2016.
On markets, Henry Burns said the UK remains very strong, with the latest AHDB R3 steer price for Aug 1st at £3.57/kg, which is equivalent to €5.36/kg incl vat. With the sterling exchange rate at 70p to the Euro, compared to 80p this time last year, he said this change is worth an additional 67c/kg in returns from the UK market.
Henry Burns said IFA was in contact with the NFU this week on the market situation and they report that attempts by the factories in the UK to ease back price increases over the last two weeks had not succeeded. The reality is that tight supplies is continuing to drive a very robust beef price market."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-coveney-must-deliver-real-access-to-new-beef-markets-ifa/,2015-08-09,Minister Coveney Must Deliver Real Access to New Beef Markets – IFA,"Speaking at the AIB National Livestock Show in Tullamore Co Offaly, IFA President Eddie Downey said the announcements from the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney and the Government on access to new beef markets to the US and China must be turned into real delivery and increased exports.
Eddie Downey said Minister Coveney needs to take action now on removing the technical obstacles holding back exports to these new markets in order to deal with increased cattle numbers in the pipeline for 2017 and to prevent a repeat of the severe beef price and income problems of 2014. He said there must be real delivery on getting real access to new markets.
The IFA President said it was very clear from the recent Beef Forum meeting that a lot more work needs to be done in getting more beef plants approved for export to the US. In addition, the Forum was also told that Ireland is still working on clearance for manufacturing beef exports to the US, with Minister Coveney saying he is confident of delivering access for manufacturing beef to the US in the next number of months.
Eddie Downey said Minister Coveney also needs to make progress on a number of other important beef issues including increasing the age limit for prime cattle from 30 to 36 months, increased monitoring of carcase trim at the meat plants, more live exports, market transparency, and using the Department AIMS system to count relevant residencies.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said in the last two weeks the factories have tried to destabilise the beef market and frighten farmers into selling cattle at lower quoted prices. He added that despite the propaganda from the meat plants, cattle supplies remain very tight and some plants were paying above quoted prices to get numbers.
Henry Burns said at the moment there is a very fine line in the balance between supply and demand, and it is clear that supplies will remain tight over the coming weeks and months. He said the facts from the latest Department AIMS data for June 1st, as presented by Bord Bia, is that there are 100,000 less cattle in the 12 to 36 month old age bracket, compared to this time last year. This will leave finished cattle supplies tight for the rest of 2015 and into 2016. In addition, this data also shows that calf registrations for 2015 are up 116,000 head, with most of the increase occurring in Angus and Hereford calves from the dairy herd.
On markets, Henry Burns said the UK remains very strong, with the latest AHDB R3 steer price for Aug 1st at £3.57/kg, which is equivalent to €5.36/kg incl vat. With the sterling exchange rate at 70p to the €uro, compared to 80p this time last year, he said this exchange rate change is worth an additional 67c/kg in returns from the UK market."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-says-real-tightness-in-cattle-market-still-to-kick-in/,2015-08-13,IFA Says Real Tightness in Cattle Market Still to Kick in,"IFA President Eddie Downey said cattle prices and supplies are on an extremely fine balance and the real tightness in the supplies of steers and heifers has yet to kick in. It is projected the kill could be back by 3,000/4,000 per week when the real tightness kicks in and this will leave farmers with steers and heifers in a much stronger position.
The IFA President said this should give confidence to the trade and with the improved weather this week, farmers are resisting the price pressure and agents are finding it much harder to buy stock at the lower quoted prices.
Eddie Downey said farmers are very annoyed with the recent price cuts from the factories which make no sense against the strength of the UK market and sterling.
The IFA President said farmers know there is a good supply of grass and understand that cattle supplies will remain tight throughout the autumn. The facts are cattle numbers in the 12-36 month age bracket are down 100,000 head on this time last year and this will defiantly tighten supplies for the next 12 months. In addition, the kill to date this year is down only 40,000, and this reduction is made up of young bulls and cull cows. He said the real tightness in steers and heifers has yet to materialise and this will leave prime cattle very tight, with the kill back 3,000/4,000 head over the coming weeks and months.
On new markets, Eddie Downey said the announcements from the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney and the Government on access to the US and China must be turned into real delivery and increased exports.
Eddie Downey said Minister Coveney needs to take action now on removing the technical obstacles holding back exports to these new markets in order to deal with increased cattle numbers in the pipeline for 2017 and to prevent a repeat  of the severe beef price and income problems of 2014. He said there must be real delivery on getting real access to new markets.
  Henry Burns said farmers at the Tullamore Show were dismissing the usual propaganda being wheeled out from the factories that they are losing money and they want to pull back store prices. He said none of these arguments stand up against a UK price which is the equivalent to €5.33/kg and sterling at 70.5p against the €uro.
  Henry Burns said the factories are trying to buy cattle this week at a base of €4.10/4.15 for steers and €4.20/4.25 for heifers. He said a lot of deals have been done at €4.15/4.20 on steers and some deals at €4.25 for early this week. He said agents are saying numbers are tightening as the week progresses and the change in the weather, and they are finding it much more difficult to buy at the lower quoted prices."
https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/ifa-protest-calls-for-eu-commission-action-on-farm-incomes/,2015-08-31,IFA Protest Calls for Eu Commission Action on Farm Incomes,"Addressing farmers from every sector and every part of the country at a protest outside the EU Commission offices in Dublin today (Mon), IFA President Eddie Downey said immediate action by the EU Commission is needed to resolve the income crisis facing farming, and especially the grain, dairy and pigs sectors. He said the EU Commissioner Phil Hogan has to move now to implement EU measures to underpin the viability of farm families.
Eddie Downey warned that farmers across a range of enterprises are under severe pressure as political interference in markets, severe price volatility and unregulated retailers combine to decimate farm incomes and undermine the sector.
In recent weeks, IFA has held discussions with farming organisations across Europe ahead of a major protest in Brussels on Monday next, 7th Sept to coincide with the emergency Farm Council meeting. Eddie Downey said that at a meeting last week with the Minister, he left him in no doubt as to what measures the EU Agriculture Ministers need to bring forward to address the crisis. The IFA President also said Minister Coveney will have to intensify his efforts to get markets open for Irish produce in the US and China. “All EU payments will have to be made on time; a 75% advance on the Basic Payment secured; and, strong funding in October’s Budget”.
IFA National Dairy Chairman Sean O’Leary added: “For dairy farmers, whose margins have come down 92% in the last 16 months, we need the EU Commission to fulfil its legal obligation under regulation 1308/2013 and review the intervention ‘reference thresholds’ in light of increased production costs and raise those prices to provide a genuine ‘safety net’ reflecting higher costs. This would send an immediate and longer term message to global buyers that EU dairy products cannot be bought below cost.”
“In addition, before year-end, the EU Commission will have a fund of over €800m worth of surperlevy fines paid by European over-quota farmers. This fund, nearly double what the EU 2016 Estimates budgeted, must not be subsumed into the EU overall budget, but be used to support dairy farmers. It is not an option to use the Crisis Reserve as this would impact all farmers’ payments. Political decisions created this problem and additional funding has to be found,” he said.
IFA National Grain Chairman Liam Dunne said the EU Commission has failed to recognise the serious income challenge facing our 11,000 full and part time tillage farmers as grain prices for the third year in a row are insufficient to cover production costs. In addition the onerous greening requirements coupled with a significant cut in growers’ basic and greening payments will aggravate the already serious income situation.
He said, “Growers are forced to produce crops to satisfy bureaucratic requirements rather than respond to market signals. The unwillingness on the part of the Commission to control speculative investment and fertiliser cartels has exacerbated income volatility leading to a boom and bust situation for many farmers. The lack of profitability in the tillage sector has resulted in a very significant fall in cereal production of close on 90,000ac since 2012.
This situation is not sustainable as any business incapable of generating sufficient profits for reinvestment will eventually collapse. The Commission must act now to:
• relax greening rules and allow farmers to grow in response to market signals;
• introduce intervention for all grains at prices that reflect production costs; and,
• abolish customs duties on non-EU fertiliser imports.
IFA Pigs Chairman Pat O’Flaherty said pig farmers across Ireland and the EU are in a serious loss-making situation and it is critical that the EU Commission look to re-open markets, including Russia, for pork products. “We also need to see the introduction of APS and export refunds to assist in the re-balancing of European markets.”
On beef, the IFA President said Minister Coveney needs to take action on removing the technical obstacles holding back exports to new markets in the US and China in order to deal with increased cattle numbers in the pipeline for 2017, and to prevent a repeat of the severe beef price and income problems of 2014. He said there must be real delivery on getting access to new markets.
Eddie Downey said with family farms so dependent on direct payments, Minister Coveney and the Department must deliver all payments on time and within the deadlines set down in the new Charter of Farmers’ Rights. He said with the income pressure on farmers this year, there is no room for any delays whatsoever on payments.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-price-cuts-must-stop-ifa/,2015-09-04,Cattle Price Cuts Must Stop – IFA,"Speaking at the IFA farmers protest in Dublin earlier this week, IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the cattle price cuts at the factories have to stop. He said livestock farmers have seen prices cut by 30c/kg or over €100/head in the last four to five weeks. Henry Burns said that these price cuts cannot be justified and he called on Minister Coveney to demand that the factories stop the price cuts.
The IFA Livestock leader told the 2,500-strong crowd at the protest outside the EU Commission office that cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have stabilised and actually increased in the last week. He said UK prices for R3 steers are the equivalent of €4.98/kg, incl. vat.
Henry Burns said that there is a very strong view in the sector that supplies of steers and heifers will tighten considerably in the next few weeks. He said all of the forecasts from Bord Bia and the Department AIMS data point to a tightening in prime cattle supplies. The AIMS data for June 1st shows that the number of cattle in the 12 to 36 month age category is down 100,000 head compared to 2014 levels. “With the steer kill up 38,000 head to date this year and the heifer kill on par with last year, supplies of steers and heifers for the remainder of 2015 are going to get very tight. This will leave farmers selling in a stronger position.”
The IFA livestock leader said factories are struggling to get cattle at less than the base price of €4.00/kg for steers and €4.10/kg for heifers. He said some factories were trying lower quoted prices but having to pay €4.00/kg base to get stock.
Speaking at a meeting of the COPA Beef Working Group in Brussels this week, Henry Burns called on Minister Coveney to insist that beef is firmly on the EU Farm Council agenda meeting in Europe next week. He said the EU needs to deal with the fallout from the Russian ban and other market access issues.
IFA has made it very clear to Minister Coveney he must turn the announcements on market access to the US and China into real exports. “The time for the media headlines is over and farmers want to see some real delivery from the Minister. We want access for manufacturing beef to the US market.”
Henry Burns also demanded that Minister Coveney insists that the EU Commission provides a 75% advance payment for the basic payment and greening from October 16th. He said livestock farm incomes are already very low and under serious pressure."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/more-positive-tone-to-beef-market-ifa/,2015-09-10,More Positive Tone to Beef Market – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said there was a more positive tone to the beef market this week and factories are having to pay 5c/kg over the quoted base price for steers of €3.95/kg to get stock. He said the improved weather and tightening supplies are lifting the trade with more farmers insisting on a base of €4.00/kg for steers and €4.10/kg for heifers.
With the IFA and MII meeting on the market situation this week, Henry Burns said there is a strong view among farmers and agents that numbers will continue to tighten. This is acknowledged by factories, with a number of them trying to tie down commitments on supplies with farmers from late October onwards. He said it is also backed up by the numbers on the AIMS data, which show that there are 100,000 fewer cattle in the 12 to 36 month age bracket available for slaughter, when compared with last year.
The IFA Livestock leader said the beef trade in the UK, our major export market had also turned positive with the AHDB reporting the R3 steer price at £3.47/kg, which is the equivalent to €5.00/kg. He said the AHDB have described “the balance of trade tipping into producer favour” and factories working to “keep a longer pipeline filled.”
Henry Burns said the official Department of Agriculture prices for week ending September 9th are also showing that prices are stabilising. He said the average R3 price for steers are at €4.09/kg and the average R3 heifer price is €4.23/kg, similar to the previous week’s level. He said the Department figures also show the both R grade and O grade cow prices have not changed at an average of €3.77 and €3.60/kg respectively. The Department report average young bull prices at"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-farmers-digging-in-hard-on-cattle-prices-ifa/,2015-09-17,Beef Farmers Digging in Hard on Cattle Prices – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has said livestock farmers are digging in hard with the factories on cattle prices. He said farmers who are negotiating hard are getting a base price of €4.00/kg on steers and €4.10/kg on heifers. He said factories are quoting lower prices, but having to pay more to get stock.
Henry Burns said at a meeting with the factories late last week, IFA made it very clear livestock farmers cannot afford any more price reductions. An IFA delegation led by the President Eddie Downey met with Meat Industry Ireland (MII) and the main factory groups in Dublin last week.
Henry Burns said IFA told MII that livestock farmers were after encountering price cuts in the order of 30c/kg or €110 per head over the last six weeks and there is severe income pressure at farm level. He said based on a continuing tight supply of prime cattle and strong returns from our main export market in the UK, there is no reason why the market situation should not remain stable.
Henry Burns said there is a strong view in the trade that cattle numbers will continue to tighten. He said this is backed up by the numbers on the AIMS database, which shows that there are 100,000 fewer cattle in the 12 to 36 month age bracket available for slaughter, when compared with last year.
Henry Burns said IFA also made it clear to the factories that they will have to offer winter finishers price contracts, especially for next spring, as feeders are not prepared to take all the risk on long keep cattle. He said Teagasc has put forward the figures showing feeders need in excess of €4.50/kg on steers next spring.
The IFA Livestock leader said the beef trade in the UK, our major export market had also turned positive with the AHDB reporting the R3 steer price at £3.55/kg, which is the equivalent to €5.11/kg, incl of 5.2% vat. He said the AHDB have described ‘the balance of trade tipping into producer favour’ and factories in Britain working to ‘keep a longer pipeline filled’."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/tighter-supplies-to-lift-beef-trade-ifa/,2015-10-08,Tighter Supplies to Lift Beef Trade – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has said the view in the beef trade this week is that cattle prices have bottomed out and are turning the corner. He said the factory tactic of cutting prices every week to force farmers out with stock has run out of road.
Henry Burns said factories are struggling to get numbers and extremely tight supplies of steers and heifers will drive prices up. He said farmers selling cattle should insist on 5c to 10c/kg over the factory quotes and dig in hard to get prices back up. This week some factories increased their base price for steers to €3.95/kg and €4.05/kg for heifers, just to hold on to stock.
Henry Burns said cattle supplies will defiantly tighten further. The latest official figures from the Department of Agriculture AIMS data for August 1st show that there is a reduction of over 70,000 head in finished cattle availability in the 24 to 36 month age bracket compared to this time last year. He said this is a major reduction in supplies and will leave factories short of stock as we enter the highest beef demand period of the year for beef.
The IFA Livestock leader said factories are currently making plans for the Christmas and New Year demand for beef against a backround of tighter supplies. Some plants are offering contracts to feeders for November/December to try and guarantee supply.
Henry Burns said the cattle price in the our main export market in Britain continues to rise with Bord Bia reporting the R3 steer price at the equivalent of €5.11/kg including vat. He said British prices have risen over the last 7 weeks and supplies are also very tight heading into the high demand season.
Henry Burns said farmers are angry with the unjustified factory price cuts of 40c/kg over the last 8 weeks which had driven producers into loss making territory."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-have-turned-the-corner-ifa/,2015-10-22,Cattle Prices Have Turned the Corner – IFA,"Speaking at the IFA Livestock meeting in Mullingar this week, IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said cattle prices have turned the corner. He said with very tight supplies, down 5,500 head per week on last year, cattle farmers are determined to get more and are insisting on a base price of €4.00/kg base for steers and €4.10/kg base for heifers. He said some factories had parted with these prices to get very scarce supplies this week.
Henry Burns said with the Department of Agriculture official figures showing that finished cattle supplies in the 24 to 36 month age group are back by 70,000 head compared to this time last year, the availability of prime steers and heifers to the factories heading into the peak Christmas demand will be extremely tight. He said with cattle prices in our main export market in Britain over the equivalent of €5.00/kg, it is clear cattle prices can rise.
The IFA Livestock leader said with additional numbers of young cattle in the system, it is essential that Minister Coveney turns the announcements on the opening of new markets into real market outlets that take real volumes. He said the lack of progress on opening the US market for manufacturing beef was disappointing and Ireland was losing out on a real higher price opportunity this year.
Henry Burns said to secure new market outlets to deal with additional numbers in 2016/2017, Ireland needs to focus on securing additional live export outlets as well as opening new beef markets. He said there were real live market opportunities in markets like Egypt, Libya, Turkey, the Lebanon and other North African countries. Henry Burns said there was increasing optimism around the possibility of something positive with live exports to Egypt and this needs to be fully facilitated and supported.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-need-to-rise-ifa/,2015-11-09,Cattle Prices Need to Rise – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said this weekend has signaled the last of the grass cattle and factories need to move on prices to reflect the higher costs of shed cattle and strong returns from the marketplace.
He said, in general the base price for steers is €3.90 with some prices of €3.95/kg and top prices of €4.00. On heifers, he said the general base price is €4.00 with some prices of €4.05 and top prices of €4.10/kg.
Henry Burns said the latest Department of Agriculture official reported prices for week ending November 1st show prices rising for steers, heifers and young bulls. Steer prices are up 2-3c/kg from the previous week with the average R=3= price at €3.99/kg. Heifer prices are also up with the average R=3= price at €4.13/kg. Young bull prices are also rising with U3 grades at €4.10/kg and R3 grades at €4.01/kg. He said cow prices on average are at €3.72 for Us, €3.58 for Rs and €3.44 for Os with P+ grades at €3.38/kg.
The IFA Livestock leader said the factories are now processing for the high demand Christmas kill and in a position to increase prices based on strong returns from the UK market. He said strong cattle prices in the UK, coupled with a very strong Sterling is giving the factories a very strong return from our main export market. He said R3 grade steers in the British market are making £3.51/kg, which is the equivalent of €5.12/kg incl. vat. He said the strength of our main export market must be reflected in higher cattle prices in Ireland.
On supplies, Henry Burns said the weekly kill remains very tight at 30,000 head. He said this tightness in supply is set to continue as the Department AIMS data shows that there is a reduction of 70,000 head in the number of finished cattle (24 to 36 month category) in the system compared to last year.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said IFA had written to Minister Coveney requesting a meeting of the Beef Forum to address a range of issues which need to be advanced and are of critical importance to the beef and livestock sector."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/farmers-very-frustrated-on-cattle-price-issues-ifa/,2015-11-30,Farmers Very Frustrated on Cattle Price Issues – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns has said cattle farmers are very frustrated that cattle prices have not moved on to reflect the higher returns from our main export market in the UK and the strength of Sterling.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said that, based on cattle prices in our main export market in the UK, where R3 steers are making £3.52/kg, the equivalent of €5.25/kg incl vat, there is real potential for Irish cattle prices to rise. He said the price gap that has opened up with Irish prices of €1.28/kg is unsustainable.
He called on Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney to immediately intervene through the Beef Forum to deal with the threats on farmers from factories on key issues around weights and specifications. He said some of the propaganda from the meat plants around weight limits are totally unacceptable and would severely damage the Irish beef sector. In addition, a weight limit would completely undermine the Quality Payment System price grid. He said the Minister needs to ensure that the agreements made at the Forum are implemented.
Henry Burns said market access is a key issue for the Forum and with an additional 130,000 cattle in the 0-12 month age bracket, it is clear the Minister needs to secure real and substantially increased market outlets in 2016/2017 to avoid a repeat of the price, marketing and income problems of 2014. He said real access to the US and China is essential and particularly access for manufacturing beef to the US. In addition, there are a number of other countries where access is required.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said that as well as the importance of securing real access to additional beef markets, access to live cattle markets are equally as important in terms of cattle price competition and additional outlets. He said there are very good opportunities available for live cattle exports to Egypt, Libya, the Lebanon and Turkey as well as Morocco and Algeria. It is vital that action is taken on securing exports to all of these live cattle markets so as to encourage the trade and maximised exports.
Henry Burns said the ongoing problems with labelling still remains unresolved and continues to negatively impact on both beef and live cattle exports to Northern Ireland, Great Britain and to some EU countries. He said Minister Coveney must guarantee that the EU single market operates properly and is not prevented from doing so.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said farmers are very concerned over the inadequate controls in place in meat plants on carcase trim and classification. He said IFA has consistently raised these issues with the Department and farmers are very disappointed, following the clear commitment made in the Forum, that there has not been more progress made with the decision to have DAFM AOs present on the killing line to monitor trim and classification as agreed.
Henry Burns said the Minister must immediately implement what was agreed on movements. He said it was agreed that the Department will adjust its AIM system to harmonise the system of counting 4 farm residencies for the QPS in-spec bonus.
Henry Burns said there is a lot of frustration that more progress has not being made with the agreed position on increasing the age from 30 to 36 months. In addition, the Forum needs to discuss other important issues such as contracts, price transparency, POs, Quality Assurance and the suckler herd."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-coveney-must-stop-factory-cuts-on-beef-farmers-ifa/,2015-12-03,Minister Coveney Must Stop Factory Cuts on Beef Farmers – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman, Henry Burns said there is growing anger among cattle farmers over the way some factories have started to manipulate cattle price cuts on weight and age, contrary to the clear agreement under the Quality Payment System (QPS).
He said some meat plants are dual pricing on weight and age and this is in direct contravention to what was agreed in the QPS and at the Beef Forum chaired by the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney.
Henry Burns confirmed that a Beef Forum meeting is scheduled for December 16th. He said the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must intervene immediately and stop the unfair price cuts factories are attempting to impose on farmers. He said “Minister Coveney has to show that he is prepared to roll up the sleeves and deal with the real issues between farmers and factories.” Henry Burns said it is no longer acceptable that beef farmers are constantly under the threat of more cuts from the factories.
On cattle prices, the IFA Livestock leader said based on returns in our main export market in the UK where cattle prices are the equivalent of €5.25/kg including vat, it is clear that there is major potential for Irish prices to rise from the current loss-making levels for winter finishers. He said the price gap of €1.28/kg that the Irish factories have opened up between Irish and UK cattle prices is unsustainable and points to a real lack of price competition. He said Minister Coveney cannot ignore this situation any longer.
Henry Burns said cattle finishers need a beef price increase to take them out of the current loss-making position selling finished cattle out of sheds, where production costs are significantly higher. He said Teagasc figures indicate beef finishers out of the shed need prices in the order of €4.50/kg.
Henry Burns said the IFA is strongly opposed to the imposition of carcase weight limits, which will have a very negative impact on the Irish beef sector and especially the suckler cow herd and quality cattle. He said this will also undermine the QPS. He pointed that average carcase weights in Ireland are below those in the UK, Italy, France and Germany.
The National Livestock Chairman said IFA will also be insisting that a number of important issues are advanced at the Beef Forum including real market access, increasing the age limit for prime cattle, improving DAFM controls on carcase trim and classification, resolving labelling issues, Quality assurance and maintaining our national suckler cow herd."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-coveney-must-stand-up-for-farmers-at-the-beef-forum-ifa/,2015-12-16,Minister Coveney Must Stand Up for Farmers at the Beef Forum – IFA,"Speaking at today’s meeting of the Beef Forum in Dublin, IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must stand up for farmers and make it abundantly clear to the factories that there can be no price cuts or dual pricing under the Quality Payment System for weight, age, breed or Quality Assurance. He said the QPS cannot work with weight limits.
He said there is growing anger among cattle farmers over the way some factories have started to manipulate cattle price cuts on weight and age, contrary to what was agreed in the QPS and at the Beef Forum chaired by the Minister Coveney. “The current situation cannot continue and Minister Coveney has to sort this out with the factories at this meeting.”
Henry Burns said Minister Coveney must tackle the lack of price competition in the beef sector. He said “The current Irish/UK cattle price gap at €1.16/kg has widened by 329% from an average of 27c/kg over the 10-year period 2004-2013. In addition, the labelling issues preventing market access for Irish cattle to our nearest markets in Northern Ireland and Britain must be resolved”. He said farmers have real concerns on competition and over dominance in the meat processing and rendering sector, and this has come to the fore again in recent days with the ABP investment in Slaney Foods and new speculation regarding Dunbia. He said IFA was in contact with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on the Slaney issue last week.
The IFA Livestock leader said beef prices need to increase from their current loss-making levels. Teagasc figures show beef finishers off grass need a price in the order of €4.00/kg just to cover costs and finishers out of the shed need prices in the order of €4.50/kg.
Henry Burns said the IFA is strongly opposed to the imposition of carcase weight limits, which will have a very negative impact on the Irish beef sector and especially the suckler cow herd and quality cattle. It would also undermine the QPS. Average carcase weights in Ireland are below those in the UK, Italy, France and Germany as per EU Commission data.
Henry Burns said farmers are very concerned over the inadequate controls on carcase trim and classification in meat plants. He said Minister Coveney needs to move immediately to instruct Department Agricultural Officers (AOs) to be present on the kill line and monitor carcase trim and classification. He said this issue must be advanced at today’s Forum meeting."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-says-minister-coveney-must-insist-factories-honour-beef-forum/,2015-12-18,IFA Says Minister Coveney Must Insist Factories Honour Beef Forum,"In what he described as a very tough and frank Beef Forum meeting, IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney made it very clear to the meat factories at this week’s meeting that there can be no dual base pricing for steers or heifers in individual processing plants by breed, age, weight or quality assurance status under the Quality Payment System (QPS).
Henry Burns said it is very clear in the Beef Forum Outcomes that there can be no weight penalties under the QPS and it is up to the Minister to insist that the factories honour this.
Henry Burns said IFA made the unacceptable and widening gap between Irish and UK cattle prices along with the issue of price competition and weights, the key issues for farmers at the Beef Forum meeting. He said it is clear from the evidence presented by Bord Bia to the Minister, farmers and factories at the meeting, that cattle prices should rise to reflect the much stronger returns from our largest export market. He said winter finishers are in a loss making situation and this position is unsustainable.
Bord Bia pointed out to the meeting that the average Irish/UK price gap for 2015 has widened to 82c/kg and is currently well over €1.00/kg. The meeting was also informed that this compares to an average of 27c/kg over the 10 years from 2004 to 2013. Bord Bia also pointed out that the exchange rate with sterling of 10% more favourable for Irish exporters this year, which is worth over 50c/kg.
When questioned by IFA and Minister Coveney at the meeting neither the factories or Bord Bia could provide any valid explanation on the widening price gap between Irish and UK cattle prices. Against this background, Henry Burns said Minister Coveney must take action and address the real issue of competition, particularly in light of recent developments for more mergers and acquisitions in the beef processing sector. In addition he said Minister Coveney has to be much more active in supporting the live export trade and securing access to our nearest and highest priced market in Northern Ireland and Britain. He said it is utterly unacceptable that Irish livestock farmers are being denied price competition through the manipulation of EU labelling rules by processors and retailers.
Henry Burns said IFA also raised important issues on market access, trade deals and climate change at the Beef Forum which was chaired by Minister Coveney. He said the Minister promised again that there will be a breakthrough for Ireland on access for manufacturing beef to the US market and on access to China for Beef early in 2016.
On Producer Organisations, Henry Burns said IFA made it clear to Minister Coveney that any new legislation must provide flexibility to ensure that both small and large groups of farmers can operate, marts must be fully accommodated and supported to act as PO’s and there must be adequate funding to prime and support groups, particularly in the start-up phase."

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-says-strong-live-export-trade-vital-for-price-competition/,2016-01-07,IFA Says Strong Live Export Trade Vital for Price Competition,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the prospects for the live export trade look much more promising for 2016.
Speaking from the Bord Bia Livestock exporters seminar in Tullamore this week Henry Burns said the major reduction in milk replacer costs and higher prices in Holland for veal calves should strongly drive calf exports. In addition, he said the slow recovery in the EU beef market and lower grain prices should boost demand for live exports of weanlings into the more intensive beef feeding systems in Italy and Spain.
Henry Burns said a strong live export trade is essential for price competition and to maximise market outlets. He said, with Bord Bia forecasting 50,000 to 80,000 more cattle for sale in 2016, a vibrant live export trade was never more important.
The IFA Livestock leader said Minister Coveney needs to prioritise the live export trade and focus on removing the barriers restricting the trade to Northern Ireland and Britain and securing access to international markets like Turkey and Egypt. He said it is not acceptable that retailers and processors are allowed to use the EU labelling rules to deny the free operation of the EU single market.
In addition, he said Ireland should have access to Turkey and Egypt like other EU countries which are exporting tens of thousands of cattle to these markets. He pointed out that last year France exported over 80,000 head to Turkey.
Henry Burns said the EU Commission is forecasting EU beef production to increase slightly in 2016 by just 0.8%. Consumption is also set to increase slightly by 0.4%.
Last year Irish livestock exports reached 177,431 head a reduction of 25% from 2014 levels."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-briefs-politicians-on-beef-and-sheep-competition-issues/,2016-01-13,IFA Briefs Politicians on Beef and Sheep Competition Issues,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney must take action to address the lack of competition in the beef sector, which is set to be compounded with the proposed ABP investment in Slaney/ICM meat group. At a briefing session with politicians in Dublin today, the IFA National Livestock leader said Minister Coveney must tackle the unacceptable price gap that has opened up between Irish and British cattle prices and remove the obstacles inhibiting the live export trade to Northern Ireland and Britain.
Henry Burns said, “At the most recent Beef Forum meeting chaired by the Minister, Bord Bia confirmed that the average Irish/UK price gap for 2015 has widened to 82c/kg or €293 per head. This compares to an average of 27c/kg (€97) from 2004 to 2013”.
Based on the market data provided by Bord Bia at the Forum, Minister Coveney concluded that cattle prices should rise from their current levels of €3.90/3.95 for steers and €4.00/4.05 for heifers, to reflect the higher returns from our main export market in the UK. Bord Bia also pointed out that the exchange rate with sterling was 10% more favourable for Irish exporters in 2015, which was worth over 50c/kg.
Henry Burns called on Minister Coveney to be much more supportive of the live export trade and secure uninhibited access to our nearest and highest-priced market in Northern Ireland and Britain. “It is the Minister’s responsibility to ensure that Irish farmers and exporters have full access to the EU single market. In this regard, he must resolve the EU labelling issues that are being used by processors and retailers to impede the live export trade and price competition.” In addition, the Minister must also lead the drive to open live markets to Egypt, Libya and Turkey.
Henry Burns said livestock farmers have real fears and concerns around the lack of competition and dominance in beef processing as well as rendering with the proposed sale of the Allen family 50% share of the Slaney/ICM business to ABP. This investment would give ABP effective control of up to 28% of the beef kill and three of the six rendering plants in the country. ICM has up to 40% of the lamb kill, and lamb processing also needs more competition.
While the investment will be subject to clearance by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CPCC), the IFA is insisting that the Government makes a submission to the CCPC through the Minister for Agriculture on the importance of guaranteeing competition in processing and rendering for farmers. He said IFA has been in contact with the CCPC and will be making a submission on the matter.
On specifications, Henry Burns said Minister Coveney made it very clear to the factories at the last Beef Forum that there can be no dual base pricing for steers or heifers in individual processing plants by breed, age, weight or Quality Assurance status under the Quality Payment System (QPS). With some factories imposing price cuts based on carcase weight, Henry Burns said the Minister has to stand up to the factories and insist that they honour the Beef Forum and QPS agreements.
He said restrictions on carcase weight would seriously damage our important suckler cow herd and our best quality cattle. Carcase weights in Ireland are below levels in the UK, Italy, France and Germany. The Minister must immediately appoint Department Agricultural Officers (AO’s) to be present on the kill line and have responsibility for monitoring carcase trim and classification in the meat plants.
IFA is seeking additional direct payments to support the suckler cow herd, to reach €200 per cow/year. In addition he said the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) must be available to all suckler farmers and requires greater flexibility on the six-year rule, reduced genotyping, accommodation of 3, 4 and 5 star animals and stocking rates.
IFA National Sheep Chairman John Lynskey said sheep farmers are equally concerned over competition and dominance in lamb processing with the ABP investment in Irish Country Meats (ICM). He added ICM currently has up to 40% of the lamb kill with their two plants in Camolin, Co Wexford and Navan, Co Meath.
On increased supports for the sheep sector, John Lynskey said IFA is seeking a targeted payment of €20 per ewe in order to maintain and support the national sheep flock. He said this is a key priority in the IFA submission to political parties and Dáil candidates for the 2016 General Election."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/farmers-should-resist-attempts-by-factories-to-talk-down-beef-prices-ifa/,2016-01-18,Farmers Should Resist Attempts by Factories to Talk Down Beef Prices – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns said the factories are attempting to erode confidence in the beef trade by threatening price and weight cuts to try and force out scarce supplies of cattle.
He said the reality is cattle supplies are very tight and our main export market in the UK is very strong, despite the changes to sterling. “Across the weekend agents are cold calling on farmers looking for cattle and offering a base of €3.95/kg for steers and €4.05/kg for heifers.”
Henry Burns was very critical of commentators jumping on the factory bandwagon to talk down the beef trade and erode farmer confidence for 2016. He said the way the figures around the extra numbers for 2016 have been used and abused is incredible. “The reality is 50,000 to 70,000 additional cattle have been forecast. These extra numbers are exaggerated as carcase weights will revert to 2014 levels or 5kgs less than 2015 levels, which amounts to a reduction equivalent to 20,000 head. In addition supplies this spring and summer will be tighter than last year with any increase only coming in the last quarter. Numbers were forecasted to be tighter pre-Christmas and this scarcity may still transpire.”
Henry Burns also said there is a good possibility that the live export trade to Libya or Egypt will resume and this will also reduce numbers. He said IFA is working hard on this.
The IFA Livestock leader called on Minister Coveney to stand up to the factories and insist that they operate the QPS properly without any weight cuts. In addition, he called on the Minister to be much more pro-active on live exports in order to tackle the lack of competition in the beef trade.
Henry Burns also called on the Minister to make a submission to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on the ABP investment in Slaney and ICM and outline his views and those of the government on the lack of competition in the meat processing and rendering sectors. He said IFA lobbied 60 TDS and Senators on the issue in Dublin last week and the majority said they were very concerned or opposed to the deal."

Henry Burns said the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority has told IFA that there is nothing stopping Minister Coveney from having a view on the proposed merger and making a submission to the Authority on the matter.
Henry Burns said IFA has called on Minister Coveney and the Government to make a submission to the CCPC on the investment, and particularly on the importance of protecting and guaranteeing competition in the processing and rendering sectors. The IFA Livestock Leader said cattle farmers cannot understand why the Minister is adopting such a detached policy on this critically important matter on competition.
Henry Burns called on Minister Coveney to take a real interest and address the lack of competition in the beef sector and the unacceptable price gap that has opened up between Irish and British cattle prices. He said Bord Bia has provided the figures which show that the average Irish/UK price gap for 2015 has widened to 82c/kg or €293 per head. This compares to an average of 27c/kg or €97 per head over the 10 years from 2004 to 2013.

He said Ireland has the potential to significantly grow live exports to the Italian market from a base of 25,000 head in 2015. In the past, Ireland exported up to 75,000 head to the Italian market.
At the Bord Bia stand at Fier Agricola, Kevin Kinsella said live exports look much more promising based on a number of factors including the continuing improvements in the quality and health status of our stock. “With Bord Bia, the Department of Agriculture and exporters, we visited a number of feedlots importing Irish cattle in Northern Italy this week. All of them clearly recognise the significant improvement in the quality and health status of Irish animals.”
“The recovery in the EU beef market, despite being slow, and lower grain prices should boost demand for live exports of weanlings into the more intensive beef feeding systems in Italy and Spain”.
In addition, Kevin Kinsella said the major reduction in milk replacer costs and higher prices in Holland for veal calves should strongly drive calf exports from Ireland this spring. “Veal prices are also going through a relatively positive period.”
Kevin Kinsella said a strong live export trade is essential for price competition and to maximise market outlets. He said, with Bord Bia forecasting 50,000 to 80,000 more cattle for sale in 2016, a vibrant live export trade was never more important.
On market access and outlets, Kevin Kinsella said Ireland needs to prioritise the live export trade and focus on removing the barriers restricting the trade to Northern Ireland and Britain as well as securing access to international markets like Turkey and Egypt. “It is not acceptable that retailers and processors are allowed to use the EU labelling rules to deny the free operation of the EU single market.”
The IFA Livestock Director said Ireland should have access to Turkey and Egypt like other EU countries which are exporting tens of thousands of cattle to these markets. He pointed out that last year France exported over 80,000 head to Turkey. “In the next few days, Egyptian vets will visit Ireland and hopefully progress can be made on access to this important market.”
Last year Irish livestock exports reached 177,431 head a reduction of 25% from 2014 levels."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/minister-has-to-address-fundamental-issues-on-price-and-weights/,2016-02-04,Minister Has to Address Fundamental Issues on Price and Weights,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Henry Burns said IFA has always supported the producer group concept, but Minister Coveney has to address the fundamental issues on price and weights.
He said the way the meat factories are imposing weight limit and age penalties on our best farmers and quality stock is a complete breach of the outcomes agreed by Minister Coveney in the Beef Forum and a move to undermine the Quality Payment System. He said the factories have shown total disregard for the Minister for Agriculture as Chairman of the Forum.
The IFA Livestock leader said it is incredible that Minister Coveney has allowed the factories to blatantly ignore one of the key outcomes in the Forum which clearly states: ‘Processors agree that there will be no dual base pricing for steers and heifers in individual processing plants, by breed, age or weight or Quality Assurance status’.
He said some of the major processor groups which agreed this with the Minister and farmers are quoting farmers two different base prices for different weights of cattle.
Henry Burns said farmers fail to understand why Minister Coveney is so reluctant to call the factories to task on this and insist that they honour the agreed outcomes of the Forum. “Farmers are demanding to know why the Minister is so much on the side of the processor and so much offside with the farmer.”
He said the weight penalties imposed by the meat plants are extremely penal and unnecessary, and target our best farmers and best cattle. He said the suckler farmers being targeted by the factories with the penal weigh cuts are our most productive and best performing breeders with the best quality stock.
Henry Burns said IFA worked with the Quality Payment System so as quality breeders and livestock were properly rewarded through improved prices. The price differentials in the QPS grid were scientifically based on Teagasc research data and did not include weight or age limits. “The factories are now trying to tear up the QPS and impose weight limit price cuts which completely ignore the science. This is not acceptable and a complete breach of what was written down by Minister Coveney in the Beef Forum.” In addition, he said the in spec bonus under the QPS is very clear and does not involve any weight limits.
Henry Burns said the imposition of penal weight limit cuts will drive more and more of our quality cattle from the suckler herd towards live exports. He said some of our best stock is already exported live but the QPS, through rewarding quality, allowed Irish farmers compete for these animals over recent years. With the weight limit cuts this will no longer be the case and more quality cattle will be exported live. He said in Italy today top quality Irish weanlings are being finished to carcase weights of up to 470 kgs at top prices of €4.40/kg."

He said livestock farmers have real fears and concerns around competition and dominance in beef processing as well as rendering in the sale of the Allen family 50% share of the Slaney/ICM business to ABP. This investment would give ABP effective control on up to 29% of the beef kill and three of the six rendering plants in the country. Sheep farmers are equally concerned over competition and dominance in lamb processing with the ABP investment in Irish Country Meats (ICM). ICM currently has up to 40% of the lamb kill and lamb processing also needs more competition.
Henry Burns said the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority (CPCC) has told IFA that there is nothing stopping Minister Coveney from having a view on the proposed merger and making a submission to the Authority on the matter.
IFA has called on the Minister and the Government to make a submission to the CCPC on the investment, and particularly on the importance of protecting and guaranteeing competition in the processing and rendering sectors. The IFA Livestock leader said cattle farmers cannot understand why the Minister is adopting such a detached policy on this critically important competition issue.
Henry Burns called on Minister Coveney to take a real interest and address the lack of competition in the beef sector and the unacceptable price gap that has opened up between Irish and British cattle prices. He said Bord Bia has provided the figures which show that the average Irish/UK price gap for 2015 has widened to 82c/kg or €293 per head. This compares to an average of 27c/kg or €97 per head over the 10 years from 2004 to 2013.
Henry Burns also called on Minister Coveney to be much more supportive of the live export trade and securing access to our nearest and highest priced market in Northern Ireland and Britain. The Minister must resolve the EU labelling issues that are being used by processors and retailers to impede the live export trade and deny price competition. The Minister must also lead the drive to open live markets to Egypt, Libya and Turkey."

Henry Burns said farmers are demanding that the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney gets stuck in and tackles the lack of competition that has plagued the Irish beef sector for years. He said, ”Livestock farmers are very frustrated because they feel the Minister is clearly leaning towards the processors and not the farmer.”
The IFA Livestock leader said Minister Coveney must understand that a sustainable Irish beef sector has to be about delivering viable prices back to primary producers and not all about cheap raw material for processors and retailers.

https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/national-farm-income-falls-in-2015/,2016-02-18,National Farm Income Falls in 2015,"The Annual IFA Farm Income Review, compiled by IFA Economist Kevin Kilcline shows that National Farm Income in 2015 is estimated to have fallen over 3% or €75m on 2014.
The fall in aggregate National Farm Income in 2015 was driven by a sharp fall in milk prices and dairy farm incomes. While there was also a fall in the prices for pigmeat, cereals and poultry, prices for sheepmeat, beef, poultry and potatoes all increased.
Output volumes are estimated to have risen significantly for the dairy and cereals sector while there was also some rise in cattle, sheep and poultry volumes. Good growing conditions for pasture and crops resulted in the maintenance of low input volumes and costs, and high output volumes across most sectors. The dreadful weather conditions and flooding experienced at the end of 2015 will have knock-on cost implications and have also caused significant disruption to the horticulture crop harvest. These impacts will manifest themselves in the National Farm Income estimates for 2016.
Sector incomes and prices
In the beef sector, an increase in beef prices of 8% for finished animals, together with a reduction in costs, led to an overall rise in output value. While cattle farmers availed of increased beef prices, initial Teagasc farm level estimates show livestock incomes remain low at €15,000 and €17,000 for suckler and beef finishing enterprises respectively. On tillage farms, average incomes are estimated at slightly less than €27,000, whilst dairy income was estimated at slightly over €37,000.
Across the other sectors, sheep farms recorded a marginal increase in prices, reflected in a slight increase in the estimated farm level income on sheep farms, of approximately €16,000. The potato sector recorded a significant price increase which comes in the context of a significant fall witnessed in 2014. The pigmeat sector recorded a fall in price and a continued increase in output, reflecting further advances in productivity. While there was a fall in feed costs, it was insufficient to compensate for the 19% drop in pigmeat prices resulting in a fall in margin for 2015 on pig farms.
Kevin Kilcline said, “Despite the positive price movements in markets for sheepmeat and beef product, the majority of farmers in the tillage, beef and sheep sectors remain completely income reliant on direct payment support. In other words, their costs of production were equal to, and on in most cases, greater than, the market returns for their product”
Cost of credit
With the abolition of milk quota in April, Dairy farmers have invested significantly in their businesses, resulting in a rise in new lending to agriculture of 17% since 2013. Despite this trend of increased lending to agriculture, the overall stock of borrowing continues to fall, suggesting that while farmers have increased their on-farm investment they continue to pay down debt at an even faster rate. While Central Bank figures support the positive lending performance of the sector showing that agriculture has highest percentage of performing loans in the SME sector (loans not in default), figures also show that Irish farmers face higher levels of credit constraint and interest rates relative to their European counterparts, particularly for smaller loans i.e. typical agricultural loans which are less than €250,000.
IFA National Chairman Jer Bergin, responding to the estimates, noted,” In real terms, farm incomes continue to fall, with National Farm Income in 2015 estimated to be only 67% of 1995 levels. When compared to other sectors of the economy, average family farm Incomes3 are only 55% of the average Industrial Wage. Despite the sector’s positive contribution to economic recovery, profitability at farm level clearly remains a major challenge across all farming enterprises. The combination of reduced national funding for farm schemes and EU CAP supports, greater exposure to volatile world markets, rising input costs and a constrained credit environment are threatening the viability of family farms.”
He continued, “More than 250,000 farm family voters are keenly following the policy proposals and commitments from the political parties and from General Election candidates at national and constituency level. They are looking for policy commitments that have at their core the need to deliver a fair return to family farms to ensure the future sustainability and growth of the agriculture industry and a vibrant rural economy.”

Jer Bergin said the Taoiseach has to set out the highly damaging implications of any Mercosur deal on farm families, particularly for beef producers, and insist that President Juncker rein in the trade negotiators who are ignoring the lack of standards that have been identified by the EU’s Food and Veterinary Office.
The IFA National Chairman has highlighted the FVO audit in Brazil in October 2014, which looked at four holdings/farms cleared for export to the EU. On the key issue of animal identification (cattle tagging and traceability), which underpins almost all animal health and food safety controls, the vets from the FVO found the following:
At one large holding, which included feedlot facilities, the authority was unable to provide an accurate number for animals that were present on the holding at the time of the visit, including the number of animals already identified and those not tagged;
Ear tags were missing or could not be accounted for. The overall situation was not helped by the fact that cattle ear tags were taken from stock in a disorganised manner, further complicating the process of checking the inventory of ear tags in stock and ascertaining which ear tags had already been applied;
After a lengthy assessment…. official services were unable to reach a final number of animals present on the holding at the time of the audit;
On the same holding, cattle ear tags were being stored for another holding which was in the initial stages of the process of seeking approval as an ERAS holding;
No records were kept of the administration of veterinary medicines to the animals. Instead, a visual method was used
Despite the above findings, the FVO report conclude ‘the controls regarding holding registration, identification and registration of cattle and animal movement controls on ERAS holdings were generally satisfactory.’
In Ireland, all animals are individually double tagged (one in each ear) within 7 days of birth and registered on a central database (AIMS) within 21 days, with an individual passport issued to the farmer, which stays with the animal for life. In addition, all movements are notified in real time or prior to movement so as to keep the AIMS accurate and up to date. All Irish cattle are registered on the AIMS database, which numbered 6,000,000 cattle at the end of last year.
Jer Bergin said, “A Mercosur trade deal would be unequivocally negative for Irish and European agriculture and would particularly damage Ireland’s important beef sector”.
“The European agricultural policy environment has changed dramatically since the last market access offer was made by the EU in 2004. The abolition of milk quotas last year has resulted in the expansion of the EU dairy herd, which is posing additional challenges for the beef sector. Previous analysis by the European Commission has shown that a Mercosur deal would inflict losses of €7.8bn on the EU agriculture sector. The individual losses at farm level would be much higher, particularly for beef farmers. This would have a major knock-on effect on rural economies, resulting in job losses”.
“Production standards in South American countries, such as Brazil, fail to meet EU standards on the key issues of traceability, animal health and welfare controls, the ban on hormone growth promoters and environmental controls.”
On climate change, Jer Bergin said the work of Irish and EU producers in reducing the carbon footprint of the livestock sector cannot be undermined by the importation of large volumes of beef from unsustainable production systems associated with widespread destruction of the rain forest in countries such as Brazil.
He said, “It would make a nonsense of EU climate change policy for Europe to agree a Mercosur deal that displaces sustainable EU beef production with product from South America, which has a much higher carbon footprint.”
The National Chairman said EU beef consumption has fallen by over 500,000t since 2010. The European market cannot absorb large volumes of imports without a very negative effect on prices and farm incomes. He said a new impact assessment of a Mercosur trade deal for European agriculture is urgently required and should be discussed in both the Council of Ministers and European Parliament before proceeding with any further Mercosur negotiations."

Henry Burns said factories are very active in trying to pin down stock over the next number of months.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/angus-woods-elected-new-ifa-national-livestock-chairman/,2016-04-20,Angus Woods Elected New IFA National Livestock Chairman,"At a meeting of the IFA National Livestock Committee in the Farm Centre in Dublin today, Angus Woods from County Wicklow was elected as the new Chairman of the IFA National Livestock Committee.
Speaking following his election, Angus Woods said his main priority will be tackling the difficult income problem in livestock farming. He said “strong viable cattle prices and active competition are essential for the beef sector.”
The new IFA Livestock Chairman also emphasised the importance of direct payments to the incomes of livestock farmers and maintaining a strong CAP, with a strong budget. He said he was very clear that the incomes of livestock farmers must improve.
Angus Woods said cattle prices, currently at a base of €4.00/kg, need to increase as they are well below the costs of production for winter finishers.
A mixed livestock, sheep and tillage farmer from Ballinabarney in County Wicklow, Angus Woods is a member of the Barndarrig branch and Wicklow County Executive of the IFA. He has served on the National Livestock Committee for the last six years.
Angus Woods thanked the outgoing National Livestock Chairman Henry Burns from County Laois who he said had worked tirelessly for livestock farmers in his role as National Livestock Chairman for the last four years."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-need-to-rise-immediately-ifa/,2016-04-28,Cattle Prices Need to Rise Immediately – IFA,"Speaking at the IFA AGM in Dublin this week, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices need to rise in order that winter finishers can avoid further losses and secure a margin on some cattle sold out of the sheds this spring. He said some finishers are securing a base of €4.05/kg on steers and €4.15/kg base on heifers.
Angus Woods said the official prices from the Department of Agriculture are showing the price increases with the R3 steer price across the country at €4.05/kg. In addition, the heifer price is up 4c/kg in a week at an average of €4.21/kg.
He said supplies will continue to tighten over the coming weeks and months until grass cattle start to flow in July. “Farmers are negotiating positively with factories at the moment both on price and specifications. Carcase weight restrictions and cuts are avoidable.”
On live exports, Angus Woods said an official announcement from the Department on the opening of the live market to Turkey is needed. He said it is positive exporters are already buying for Turkey with weanlings under 12 months of age and under 300kgs in strong demand. “With increased supply numbers forecasted for later in 2016, we need to get exports moving to Egypt.”
In addition, he said the Minister and the EU Commission must resolve the labelling issues on live exports to Northern Ireland and Britain.
Angus Woods called for a re-opening of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme immediately saying that the €52m in funding secured by IFA needs to be utilised and paid out to farmers. He said IFA is very strong that direct payments for suckler cows must be increased and IFA is targeting a payment of €200 per cow.

In addition, he said sellers are doing deals involving payment for transport and no weight specification cuts.
Angus Woods said it is clear that supplies of steers and heifers will remain very tight for the next number of months and finishers have to maximise their bargaining power in this situation.
Bull prices have also improved with U grades at €4.00/4.05. He said P and O grade cows are making €3.30/kg."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/uk-and-irish-livestock-representatives-working-on-cattle-and-sheep-issues/,2016-05-20,Uk and Irish Livestock Representatives Working on Cattle and Sheep Issues,"The main farmer unions for livestock farmers from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland, represented by the NFU, NFUS, NFU Cymru, UFU and IFA met in Buxton, England this week to discuss key cattle and sheep issues.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods, who attended the meeting, said beef farmers have come through a long hard winter and spring with very high costs. He said, in order to maintain a sustainable supply of high quality beef, retailers and processors must recognise that beef prices need to be above the costs of production, and this is currently is not the case.
On changes to specifications and price grids being imposed on producers by processors, Angus Woods said factories cannot act unilaterally in this area and will have to work with farmer representatives. He said weight and other penalties are totally unfair and will impose severe penalties on farmers. He said specifications must take account of the positive British and Irish production systems and price grids must be cost neutral to the sector.
Sheep
On sheep, IFA National Sheep Chairman John Lynskey said price stability in the market for the next month is crucial as it sets the pattern for the rest of the season, which in turn will be key to incomes for sheep farmers in 2016. He said demand will increase over the next few weeks driven by the retail changeover to spring lamb and also by the festival of Ramadan which commences on 7th June.
The UK and Irish farm representatives were strongly supportive of work of the EU Sheep Reflection Group, which was set up by EU Agricultural Commissioner Phil Hogan. John Lynskey said, “It is essential that the EU Sheep Reflection Group brings forward a set strong and practical recommendations for the sheep sector focusing on the key issues of incomes, supports, consumption, promotions, trade and technology. In addition, the really positive public goods and value delivered by the sheep sector to the wider society must be fully recognised.”
Trade issues
On the EU trade negotiations for TTIP and Mercosur, Angus Woods welcomed the decision to remove the beef TRQ’s from the offer transmitted to the Mercosur countries by the EU and recognised the positive work of EU Agricultural Commissioner Phil Hogan in defending the beef sector.
Angus Woods said the EU cannot allow beef imports into the European market which fail to meet EU standards across the key areas of traceability, food safety and animal health controls, animal welfare and environmental standards including carbon footprinting. In addition, he said the EU must not proceed with any further negotiations until they complete and publish a full impact assessment of all the trade deals in the beef sector."

Factory agents are very active on the ground and in marts in attempts to secure numbers of suitably-finished cattle for immediate slaughter. Farmers should strongly resist lower-quoted prices.
In a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed last Thursday before the UK voted, Angus Woods had called for the Beef Forum to be reconvened. In light of the result on Friday last, it is a matter of urgency that the Minister immediately convenes the Beef Forum.
Angus Woods said there are a number of issues that need to be addressed, including clear direction and certainty for beef farmers in relation to our most important export market, both in the short term and the long term."

Joe Healy said the Beef Forum must provide clear direction and certainty for beef farmers in relation to our most important export market, both in the short term and the long term.
The IFA President said, “The UK market is heavily dependent on supplies of Irish beef. It is vital that our processors take full advantage of the strong market conditions to protect farmers. The current markets conditions in the UK, driven by tight supplies and strengthening prices, put our beef processors in a strong negotiating position to protect returns to farmers during this short-term volatility”.
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices in the UK continue to strengthen on the back of tight supplies, providing a real opportunity for our factories to maximise returns for Irish beef, which is best placed to meet the strong demand.
“While the UK is an important market for Irish beef, half of our exports go to other European and international markets, which are not directly impacted by these events.”
The IFA Livestock Chairman said supplies of suitably-finished cattle remain extremely tight.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/factories-focus-should-be-on-strong-uk-market-returns-ifa/,2016-07-02,Factories Focus Should Be on Strong Uk Market Returns – IFA,"IFA President Joe Healy has said the strong market conditions in the UK for beef are being ignored by the meat factories, which are engaging in scaremongering with farmers. He warned against excessive use of the decision to leave the EU as a lever on price, saying market access for Irish beef is unchanged and demand for product continues to strengthen.
“While the issue of market access for Irish produce will be critical in the discussions over the next two years, the situation remains unchanged until that process has concluded. The use of this as an excuse by factories to lower prices is opportunistic at the expense of farmers and a failure by them to reflect the reality of what is available from the UK market place.”
Joe Healy said, “The UK market is heavily dependent on supplies of Irish beef. It is vital that our processors take full advantage of the strong market conditions to protect farmers. The current markets conditions in the UK, driven by tight supplies and strengthening prices, puts our beef processors in a strong negotiating position to protect returns to farmers during this period of short-term volatility”.
The IFA President said the Beef Forum, which will meet in the next fortnight, must provide clear direction and certainty for beef farmers in relation to our most important export market, both in the short term and the long term.
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices in the UK continue to strengthen on the back of tight supplies, providing a real opportunity for our factories to maximise returns for Irish beef, which is best placed to meet the strong demand.
“While the UK is an important market for Irish beef, half of our exports go to other European and international markets, which are not directly impacted by these events.”
The IFA Livestock Chairman said supplies of suitably-finished cattle remain extremely tight. Factory agents are very active on the ground in attempts to secure numbers of cattle for immediate slaughter. Farmers should strongly resist lower-quoted prices. This week steers traded at €4/kg and heifers at €4.10/kg with cattle also bought for next week at these prices despite factories quoting 5 – 10c/kg less. He said seasonally we are at the peak of the cow kill, with a sharp drop off in numbers slaughtered in previous years from mid-July onwards which should impact positively on demand for cows."

  He said demand for beef from UK supermarkets is particularly strong, with prices rising a further 2p/kg in the past week as numbers of finished prime cattle remain tight in the UK. The weekly kill here dropped, with a significant reduction in heifer and cow numbers, reflecting the tight supply/demand reality on the ground.
  Angus Woods said based on these figures, farmers should strongly resist the factories’ price cuts, which are unjustified. “Rather than attempt to exploit the post-referendum situation, they have a responsibility to reflect the strong market conditions in the UK and maximise the return to producers.”
  The IFA Livestock Chairman warned against using the referendum result as a lever on price, saying market access for Irish beef is unchanged and demand for product continues to strengthen, while beef exporters would have been hedged against currency movements.  “Using market access as an excuse to lower prices is opportunistic and does not reflect the reality of what is available from the UK market place.”

Joe Healy said the meeting would be used to outline very clearly to Minister Creed the financial pressure farm families are under this year as a result of lower prices, higher costs and reduced direct payments. Joe Healy added that immediate action is required on state aid for low cost credit to all sectors, full draw down of the farm schemes, inclusion of the additional €25m for ANCs and new €25m Sheep scheme in this October’s Budget, 70% payments advance, retail regulation and trade deals.
The IFA President said urgent action is needed by the Government to provide low-cost short–term loans to alleviate cash flow pressures and reduce the high cost of merchant credit, adding that the EU Agriculture Council has already given the go ahead for this state aid in this area.
Beef Forum and cattle prices
Joe Healy said the Beef Forum, which will meet in the next fortnight, must provide clear direction and certainty for beef farmers in relation to our most important export market, both in the short term and the long term.
He accused meat factories of unnecessarily pulling beef price quotes on the back of the Brexit referendum result, even though they are hedged against currency volatility. Factories are paying prices of €3.95/kg and €4.00/kg this week for steers and €4.05-€4.10/kg for heifers, reflecting the tightness of the market and are 5-10c above what has been quoted.
Joe Healy said demand for beef from UK supermarkets is particularly strong, with prices rising a further 2p/kg in the past week as numbers of finished prime cattle remain tight in the UK.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-creed-must-call-factories-to-order-on-beef-ifa/,2016-07-14,Minister Creed Must Call Factories to Order on Beef – IFA,"IFA President Joe Healy has strongly criticised the meat factories for overhyping the Brexit result in their rush to pull cattle prices.
He said “Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed must call the factories to order, insist they act responsibly and stop undermining confidence in the beef sector”.
Joe Healy said the factories have overdone the negativity in the three weeks since the Brexit result and attempted to create panic in the trade, “This is highly irresponsible at a time when all stakeholders need to put on the green jersey and work together to minimise instability”.
The IFA President said, “Now is the time for Bord Bia and the factories to fully utilise our strengths and maximise our unique Origin Green programme and Quality Assurance standards at retail and food service level, as opposed to pulling prices at farm level despite protection through currency hedging.” He said Minister Creed needs to knock heads together and make this happen.
Joe Healy said the rapid appointment of the new Prime Minister in the UK is a positive development, which has eliminated two months of uncertainty and has led to a significant recovery in sterling and the markets.
He said Minister Creed needs to make a move on beef with the factories ahead of the Beef Forum, set for Thursday July 21st. The IFA Leader said there is a real urgency on the Minister to make it clear to the factories that they must act responsibly in the context of the Brexit result."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/factory-beef-price-cuts-unjustified/,2016-07-18,Factory Beef Price Cuts Unjustified,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed will have to get tough with the meat factories at the Beef Forum later this week.
He said, “Farmers are very angry at the way the factories are continuing to pull prices and undermine the beef market and confidence in the sector since the Brexit outcome.”
Angus Woods said farmers are resisting factory pressure on prices and rejecting the lower quoted prices. He said, despite dropping quotes, farmers are digging in for a base of €3.90 on steers and €4.00/kg on heifers. “Supplies are tight and in cases where the lower quoted prices were rejected, factory agents have had to revert with higher prices to get cattle,” Woods said
The IFA Livestock Leader said UK cattle prices are continuing to rise strongly since the Brexit outcome.
In addition he said the Sterling exchange has strengthened considerably. He said “Since the Brexit result, UK cattle prices have risen 7p/kg and the exchange has strengthened from 87p back to 83.5p/€. The UK R3 steer price for week ending July 9th was at £3.39/kg, which is equivalent to €4.27/kg including VAT.
Angus Woods pointed out that taking account of the increase in the UK prices and the exchange rate adjustments, UK beef prices have only come back by the equivalent of 15c/kg since Brexit. However, he said the factories are trying to impose as much as a 30c/kg cut at farm level on the back of this."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/more-bite-to-beef-trade-ifa/,2016-07-20,More Bite to Beef Trade – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said there is more bite in the beef trade this week with farmers strongly resisting the lower quoted prices from the meat factories and negotiating more.
He said with the good weather and farmers very busy at silage, combined with tight supplies, factories are having to pay 5 to 10c/kg over quotes to get cattle.
Angus Woods said the general run of prices is €3.85/kg base for steers and €3.95/kg base for heifers but farmers are getting €3.90 and €4.00/kg base in places this week.
Angus Woods said the first of the grass cattle are gone and prime finished cattle numbers remain tight. He said with good grass, cattle are thriving strongly at the moment.
Angus Woods said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK continue to rise with prices up 7p/9p/kg since the Brexit result in late June.
He said sterling also seems to have settled at 83.5p/€ and this is much improved from the original position post Brexit. He added with the UK R3 steer price at £3.39/kg, this is equivalent to a return of €4.27/kg including VAT."

He strongly criticised the meat factories for overhyping the Brexit result in their rush to pull cattle prices.
At a meeting of the IFA Executive Council yesterday, which was attended by the Minister, Joe Healy said the Minister needs to outline the beef sector’s strategy on Brexit, which cannot be based on factory price cuts.
“The Government must lead the national response on Brexit. The UK is our largest and most valuable beef export market. We need a very clear action plan around utilising our strengths on our unique Origin Green programme and Quality Assurance standards at retail and food service level. We need a strong initiative in the market to maintain and build on the positive long-term relationships established over the last 20 years.”
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods told Minister Creed that the Forum needs to address the ability of the factories and markets to handle increased numbers at viable prices for farmers. He said some of the recent communications and actions are sending all of the wrong signals.
Minister Creed told the IFA meeting there must be a fair return from the market on beef. He said “We need to work together in the Beef Forum to get the best return for primary producers, as without viable beef farmers there can be no industry”."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-president-tells-minister-creed-beef-forum-must-deliver-for-farmers/,2016-07-21,IFA President Tells Minister Creed Beef Forum Must Deliver for Farmers,"At the Beef Forum meeting in Dublin today, IFA President Joe Healy made it very clear to the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, and the Forum, that the post-Brexit negativity and price cuts by the meat factories were excessive, and undermining confidence in the sector.
Joe Healy emphasised to the Minister that to be effective the Beef Forum has to work for the whole sector and that means it must deliver for farmers as well as for others.
The IFA President said the meat factories had overhyped the Brexit result and taken advantage on cattle price. He said beef industry commentators had suggested that the Sterling devaluation was 16% and some even went as far as 25% “This was totally incorrect and the facts are the Sterling adjustment is 7%. In addition, UK beef prices have increased by 10p/kg since Brexit.”
He said the increase in UK cattle price and the correct Sterling adjustment would change UK returns by only 8c/kg and not the severe price cuts of 25/30c/kg factories have imposed.
Joe Healy called on the factories to stop the negativity and the price cuts. He told Minister Creed it is vital that confidence is restored and maintained at farm level.
Bord Bia presented forecast cattle supply figures to the Forum which showed a reduction of 44,000 head in the number of beef cattle in the 24-36 month age group compared to June 1st last year. This should leave prime finished cattle supplies tight over the coming weeks and months. The Bord Bia figures also show that there is a considerable increase in younger cattle numbers from increased registrations and lower live exports.
Joe Healy said with the increase in younger cattle supplies, the Beef Forum has to ensure that there are adequate markets and outlets to meet the increase and return a viable and competitive price to farmers above the costs of production.
The IFA President also raised a number of other issues at the Forum including increased resources on market access, the Government strategy on Brexit, reopening the Beef Data and Genomics Scheme, live exports and Turkey, and specifications including age, weight and residencies."

He said factories are finding it much more difficult to get adequate numbers of stock and many are paying a base of €3.85 for steers and €3.95 base for heifers. He said the trade is also being helped by very good grass growth and good thrive. He added that the better demand is also being reflected in the mart with more factory buyers around the ring for finished cattle.
Angus Woods said farmers needed to dig in hard on the price and demand more than the quotes. He said the reality is cattle numbers in the factory lairages are very scarce and agents and procurement managers are very anxious for stock. He said, “Agents have been told not to leave stock behind them.”
Angus Woods said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK continue to rise, up another 1p/kg last week. He said UK prices are now up 26p/kg since the end of April. He pointed out that UK cattle prices are up 13p/kg since the Brexit decision in late June. As of July 30th, the UK R3 steer price was €3.46/kg, which is equivalent to €4.30/kg.
On numbers, Angus Woods said the weekly kill was at 30,586, with the total kill running 26,203 ahead of last year’s levels.
Angus Woods said factories are also stronger for cows this week with more outlets paying €2.90/3.10 for P and O grade cows. Better cows are making €3.20/3.30."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/more-resources-required-for-live-export-trade-ifa/,2016-08-11,More Resources Required for Live Export Trade – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said it is essential that more resources are provided to assist the live export trade on market access.
He said, “No effort can be spared to get the vitally important live export trade to Turkey moving as soon as possible. IFA is continuing to work with exporters and the Department of Agriculture to progress matters.”
Angus Woods said IFA has made it very clear to the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed that a strong live trade in the autumn is essential for competition and to put a strong floor under weanling prices. He said there is a very strong focus on market access for the beef trade and a similar drive must be made by the Minister, the Department and Bord Bia for the important live trade.
Irish exporters are involved in the recent tender from Turkey and negotiations are continuing, as well as arrangements for the various requirements to meet the veterinary certificate and transport. Angus Woods said some of these requirement are complex and a more flexible and accommodating approach is required. He said timing is very important with weanling sales and numbers at the marts increasing significantly over the next number of weeks.
Angus Woods said Turkey is a major opportunity for the Irish livestock sector and has an import requirement for up to 400,000 head of live cattle annually. In 2015, Turkey imported 380,000 head of cattle, the majority from South America and up to 120,000 head from France.
“Turkey is a high volume live cattle destination, capable of paying very good prices,” Angus Woods said, adding that beef cattle prices in Turkey are the equivalent of €7.50 to €8/kg and feeders pay up to €4 – €4.50/kg live weight for younger stock.
IFA has been pushing to get the live trade to Turkey open since last year and, following a lot of hard work as well as several visits by Turkish and Irish delegations, the opening of the trade was announced.
The IFA Livestock Leader said the immediate requirement in Turkey is for younger stock, bull weanlings up to 12 months of age and up to 300kgs from beef breeds."

He said, “The beef and sheep sectors are the heartbeat of rural Ireland, involving over 100,000 farmers and generating economic activity in every single parish across the country”.
On the market situation, Joe Healy said cattle prices are back an average of 40c/kg or €145 per head on this time last year. “This is having a severe income hit on farmers selling finished cattle off grass and also weanling and store producers selling at the marts. Minister Creed must deliver real access to new markets and strong competition in the trade in order to return viable prices to farmers.”
Joe Healy said practical measures are required to respond to the challenge of Brexit. With additional cattle numbers in the country he called on the Government to commit additional resources, in terms of manpower and funds, to secure greater market access for beef and live cattle. He said “It is essential more resources are provided to assist the live export trade and no effort can be spared to get the vitally important trade to Turkey moving as soon as possible. IFA has made it very clear to Minister Creed that a strong live export trade this autumn is essential for competition and to put a strong floor under weanling prices”.
In Budget 2017, Joe Healy said IFA is demanding an increase in support for our national suckler herd, which forms the basis of our 500,000t of quality beef exports. He said Minister Creed should immediately reopen the Beef Data and Genomics Scheme to farmers and provide an additional €25m in the Budget to increase payments to suckler farmers.
For sheep farmers, Joe Healy said IFA has secured €25m in the programme for Government for a new €10 per ewe sheep scheme. He said it is essential this scheme is finalised quickly with the EU Commission and progressed in order that farmers can apply and be guaranteed payment in 2017.
IFA is also insisting that the additional €25m allocated for ANCs payments is brought forward to Budget 2017, made available to farmers next year and not delayed until 2018 as currently planned.
Joe Healy said IFA has negotiated a 70% advance on the Basic Payment Scheme and higher advances for some RDP schemes for the autumn payment run. He said it is essential that the Department of Agriculture make all direct payments on time and in line with the deadlines set down in the Charter of Rights.

He said, with the good weather farmers are very busy and factories are finding it very difficult to get adequate numbers. He said in some cases in the last week top prices of €3.90 and €4.00/kg were paid to get stock.
Angus Woods said with the schools reopening across our main markets in the UK and the EU, beef demand will pick up as is normal at this time of the year.
The IFA Livestock Leader said in the UK market, our main export destination, cattle prices continue to increase, up another 3p/kg again last week. He said the AHDB report that cattle prices in Britain have increased by 10p/kg in the last 3 weeks and are up 35p/kg since May 1st.
He said the R3 steer beef price in Britain is £3.57/kg, which is equivalent to €4.39/kg including VAT.
On numbers, Angus Woods said the weekly kill is running at just over 30,000 head. He said the AIMs data would point to tight finished cattle supplies over the coming weeks. Compared to the same period last year, the number of beef cattle in the 24 to 36 month age category are down 44,000 head compared to June 2015.

https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/proposed-abpslaney-meats-deal-is-likely-to-weaken-competition-ifa/,2016-08-31,Proposed Abp/slaney Meats Deal Is Likely to Weaken Competition – IFA,"IFA President Joe Healy said an independent report commissioned by the IFA on the proposed ABP/Slaney meats deal raises serious competition issues for farmers which must be addressed by the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC).
He was speaking at the launch of the report prepared by Dr Pat McCloughan of PMCA Economic Consulting, which the IFA has already submitted to DG Competition in Brussels.
Joe Healy said the main conclusion of the report is that the primary procurement market for farmers selling cattle in Ireland to the meat factories is characterised by weak competition and the proposed deal is likely to weaken competition even further, through a ‘substantial lessening of competition’ (SLC). He said the report outlines the chief concern over the proposed transaction is that it would make coordinated effects in the relevant markets more likely.
IFA has sent a copy of the submission to Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and the CPCC, as well as the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK. Joe Healy said, “This report is very clear on the competition concerns in the beef sector, the income pressures that exist for livestock producers and the impact that any weakening of competition would have on their livelihoods”.
Joe Healy said farmers are already very concerned about the lack of competition in the beef sector and this report on the proposed ABP/Slaney deal will heighten their fears.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “Competition in the beef and lamb trade is always a contentious issue between farmers and factories. The Minister and the relevant authorities must be able to guarantee farmers that there is maximum competition operating in the market”. He said the report also highlights the necessity for DG Competition to examine the competition issues around rendering and factory feedlot cattle as well as the processors relationships with retailers.
Presenting the findings of the report, Dr Pat McCloughan pointed out that ABP and Slaney combined currently account for 25.8% of all cattle slaughterings in the state. When the market is narrowed down to premium cattle of steers and heifers meeting the MII grade and weight specifications, this figure rises to 36.2% of cattle.
Using competition economic analysis based on the HHI measure of market concentration, Dr. McCloughan’s report shows that across the full national geographic market, the HHI Delta is 469 for premium cattle purchased.
However, the analysis also reveals that when the more narrow relevant market of the South Leinster region is used, ABP and Slaney combined would have 44% of the premium cattle kill and the HHI Delta would rise to 959.
Dr McCloughan explained that a HHI Delta above 250 can be a cause of concern and when taken in the context of a market sector with high regulatory barriers to entry and high switching costs as well as other sources of weak competition, this raises serious competition concerns.
Dr McCloughan said “The market share of Slaney is much higher in the narrower geographic market of South Leinster and it emerges that Slaney is the closest competitor to ABP for premium cattle. In each and every analysis, the HHI Delta exceeds 250, by some margin”.
The PMCA economist outlined the growing gap in cattle prices between Ireland and Britain, our largest export market, and highlighted the structural differences in cattle procurement between the two markets. He said the only real route to market in Ireland for finished cattle is directly to the factories, while data from GB showed that 19.4% of slaughtered cattle came through the auction market system.
Dr McCloughan also said that the Irish beef processing industry is much more concentrated than that in England (which is about the same size as the Irish cattle procurement market), with large processors (slaughtering more than 50,000 head of cattle) accounting for 85% of the kill compared to 50% in England. In contrast, small and medium sized processors account for 43.3% of the kill in England and only 8.9% in Ireland.
On sheep meat, the report points out that Slaney/ICM is the largest processor of sheep/lamb meat in the State, with around 40% of the kill. While ABP does not process sheep/lamb meat in Ireland, it is active in this area in Northern Ireland and in England.
The ‘footprint’ of the parties (ABP and Slaney/ICM) is extensive in meat processing in Ireland and the UK, not to mention the competition implications of the proposal in retail markets in Ireland, the UK and the EU, owing to the fact that most of the beef and lamb meat produced in Ireland is exported. This in turn necessitates the view elaborated in the PMCA report that the proposal, if it is notified to the European Commission, should also involve the Irish and UK competition authorities.
The overall conclusion of the PMCA report is that the “relevant market affected by the proposed transaction is characterised by weak competition and that the proposed deal poses a risk of an SLC in the State or an SIEC at EU level” (significant impediment to effective competition, the merger control test applied by the European Commission, which is basically the same as the SLC test applied in Ireland and the UK).
The PMCA report also contains suggestions aimed at helping to inform the competition authorities in Brussels, Dublin and London for further examination in respect of the relevant market’s capacities, vertical integration and features that might serve to underpin processors’ apparent bargaining advantages over producers/farmers in Ireland.

Angus Woods said this is seen as a crude move to take advantage of the weather difficulties experienced by some farmers and it is not based on the market with UK prices rising again last week by another 3.5p/kg.
Angus Woods pointed out that cattle prices in Britain have now risen by 40p/kg since May 1st this year. At the current exchange rate of 84.5p/€, this is equivalent to a price increase of 50c/kg including VAT. Angus Woods said the UK R3 steer price is no £3.60/kg, which is equivalent to €4.48/kg including VAT.
He said the majority of cattle are moving at a base of €3.80 for steers and €3.90/kg for heifers."

He set out the farm scheme and taxation measures required in the Budget and the response needed to deal with the impact of Brexit.
Budget 2017 – Farm Schemes
Joe Healy said the Government must use Budget 2017 to take funding and taxation decisions to alleviate farm income difficulties and underpin the longer-term development of the sector.
IFA is clear that, having experienced a reduction in funding to the agriculture budget of almost 40% during the downturn, there must be an increase in funding in this year’s budget for important farm schemes.
Our expenditure priorities for farm schemes in Budget 2017 are:
Funding of €250m for agri-environment schemes, with full payments for all GLAS, AEOS and organic scheme participants.
Introduction of the targeted sheep scheme of €25m, with minimal costs and bureaucracy on farmers, to maximise its benefits.
Additional funding for the ANCs to reach €225m, commencing the process of restoring ANC payments to 2008 levels.
Immediate reopening of the Beef Data and Genomic Programme to allow new participants, with additional funding of €25m to increase support for the suckler cow.
A funding allocation of €50m to the TAMS II programme to meet the demand across all farming sectors for on-farm investment.
In addition, Farm Assist is a vitally important scheme for low income farm families, particularly in a year like 2016.
IFA recognises the commitment to a review of Farm Assist in the Programme for Government. The income and child disregards that were fully abolished in recent years must be reinstated in this year’s Budget.
Budget 2017 – taxation
Budget 2017 also provides the opportunity to address ongoing challenges in farming through the taxation system. Income volatility is a real challenge. The barriers preventing more farmers from using income averaging must be removed as a priority. A more targeted and individualised volatility scheme is required.
IFA proposes that:
To maximise the number of farmers using income averaging, the current restrictions on eligibility where the farmer’s spouse is in self-employment must be removed
In addition, the income averaging system must be adjusted to allow a farmer on averaging, in a year when income falls significantly, to pay the tax due for a single year only. The deferred tax would then be carried forward and paid over a three year period. This flexibility could assist greatly with cashflow pressures.
Last October’s budget finally saw the first steps in removing the discrimination of the self-employed in the income tax system with the introduction of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
We recognise the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase this to match the PAYE credit, by 2018. However, IFA believes that the Government should equalise the credits fully by 2017, which would give a direct cashflow boost to farmers and other self-employed.
Access to credit – low cost cashflow funding
The farm income difficulties are being compounded by a clear market failure in the Irish financial sector. The lack of competition and flexibility within the banking sector is affecting farmers’ ability to secure finance at a reasonable cost Extending merchant credit to deal with cashflow pressures is a high cost and inefficient form of short-term farm financing.
IFA has identified clearly that the Government, and Minister for Agriculture, must deliver alternative sources of lower cost long and short term funding for farm enterprises.
The €11.1m funding allocation for dairy and other livestock farmers agreed by the EU in July must be matched by national funding, to bring the total package value to €22.2m. This must then be used to help farmers with their cash flow difficulties.
The Minister must not lose sight of the need to allow farmers in all sectors to convert their accumulated merchant credit, utility, superlevy and other bills into low cost, short term loans. This type of loan package, based on the €15,000 state aid de minimis rules has been proposed by IFA earlier this summer, and while the response from the Minister has been positive, the time for delivery is now.
Joe Healy said farmers were very angry at the behaviour of the meat factories in the weeks following the vote in overhyping the Brexit result in their rush to pull cattle prices. “Their behaviour was simply an attempt to create panic in the trade and was not reflective of the strong market conditions for finished cattle that existed, and continue to exist in the UK market.”
Brexit measures
The more labour intensive sectors in agriculture are seriously affected by the impact on prices arising from exchange rate volatility. Those particularly affected in the short-run are the domestic horticulture sector and our mushroom industry. Almost all of their €120m of exports are destined for the UK market.
It is critical that action is taken in Budget 2017 to offset this negative impact and maintain cost competitiveness. In this context, IFA proposes:
The lower rate of employer PRSI should be temporarily reduced, to reduce employment costs for export-dependent SMEs in all sectors;
There must be no increase in excise rates for Marked Gas Oil (Agricultural Diesel). In addition, given the importance of maintaining competitiveness, we would have to question any move by the Government to increase excise rates on other road fuels at this time."

IFA President Joe Healy accused retailers and processors of failing to honour their responsibilities to farmers and consumers. He said, “Retailers are guilty of using farmer profiles to market our top quality beef to consumers pretending they are returning a fair price to the farmer. However, the reality is retailers are turning their backs on farmers by allowing processors to drive down prices to unsustainable loss-making levels.” Joe Healy said what is happening to beef prices is anything but fair trade.
Joe Healy said, “Since May 1st, factories have cut prices to Irish farmers by 35c/kg, from €4.10 back to their current quoted base price of €3.75/kg, forcing farmers into a loss-making situation. Over the same period, prices in our main export market in the UK have risen by the equivalent of 50c/kg. UK beef prices are currently £3.60/kg and at the current exchange rate of stg 85p/€, this is equivalent to €4.48/kg including Vat”. Joe Healy said these price cuts are totally unjustified and not based on market returns.
The IFA President pointed out that with average Irish retail price for beef at €8.92/kg, retailers and processors have plenty of margin to pay producers a sustainable beef price in the range of €4.00/kg to €4.50/kg, which Teagasc has stated is necessary for cattle produced off grass and for winter finishers.
Joe Healy said the beef price paid to the farmer is totally transparent and the lack of margin at farm level is there for everybody to see. However, he said there is no transparency on the profits of the major players in the industry or the money taken out of the price chain at each stage. “The failure to regulate the retailers and processors in the food chain is allowing them to drive prices to unsustainable levels. Retailers’ claims about sustainability are meaningless without a sustainable price back to farmers.”
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods accused the processors of exploiting difficult weather conditions, particularly in the west of Ireland. “We had the same tactics after Brexit, when the processors jumped the gun to turn the screw on prices. The market returns simply do not justify the cuts imposed on producers. Without a decent margin, farmers cannot survive”.
Today’s protest also heard strong criticism of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which has refused to investigate the competition issues raised by the independent report submitted by IFA to DG Competition in Brussels and the CCPC.
Joe Healy said farmers would be flabbergasted to discover that the CCPC has effectively washed its hands of their responsibility to investigate serious competition issues in the Irish beef sector which are highlighted in the report. “For the CCPC to conclude that the proposed Slaney/ABP deal does not ‘threaten to affect significantly competition in a market’ beggars belief”."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/negative-pressure-on-cattle-prices-totally-unjustified/,2016-09-19,Negative Pressure on Cattle Prices Totally Unjustified,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said the ongoing negative pressure from factories on cattle prices is totally unjustified when cattle prices in our main export market in the UK continue to rise strongly.
Angus Woods said that since May 1st Irish cattle prices have fallen by 35c/kg, from €4.10 back to their current base price of €3.75/kg, forcing farmers into a loss-making situation. Over the same period, prices in our main export market in the UK have risen by the equivalent of 54c/kg. UK beef prices are currently £3.64/kg and at the current exchange rate of stg 85.5p/€, this is equivalent to €4.48/kg including VAT”. He said the latest price cuts are totally unjustified and not based on market returns.

He said based on the market returns from the UK, it is clear the factories could easily reverse some of the price cuts of recent weeks and increase returns to Irish farmers currently selling at a loss.
Joe Healy said factories have cut beef prices in Ireland by up to 20c/kg since September 1st , while prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 2-3p/kg per week, every week since early May. He said currently beef prices in the UK are £3.64/kg, which is equivalent to €4.43/kg incl vat. This week factories are quoting €3.70/kg for R3 grade steers in Ireland, opening up a massive gap of 70c/kg or €250 per head with prices in our best and nearest export market.
The IFA President said the market figures clearly show that the price cutting tactics of the meat factories are unjustified and have driven livestock farmers into serious loss making territory as well as shaken confidence in the sector.
Joe Healy said the last available set of AIMS data from the Department of Agriculture on cattle supplies show that numbers in the 24-36 month age category for beef cattle are well down by 44,000 head compared to 2015 figures. He said in the last 3 weeks supplies have been strong and a lot of cattle have been killed and this could leave supplies tighter in the weeks and months ahead. He added that factories had taken advantage of the bad weather and increased supplies in Western and Northern counties in recent weeks to unfairly pull prices.
The IFA President said the first boat load of live cattle are arriving in Turkey and hopefully many more shipments will follow over the coming weeks and months. He said shippers are actively buying in the marts and the live trade had brought competition as well as putting a floor in the price as the autumn weanling sales had kicked in."
https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/competition-issues-remain-despite-eu-commission-decision-on-slaney/,2016-10-07,Competition Issues Remain Despite Eu Commission Decision on Slaney,"IFA President Joe Healy said the serious issues around competition in the beef sector, highlighted in the PMCA report commissioned by IFA into the ABP/Slaney deal, have not gone away and must be addressed to have a sustainable and profitable beef sector for Irish livestock farmers.
The IFA President was responding to reports of a decision by DG Competition in Brussels today to clear the way for the ABP/Slaney deal.
Joe Healy said farmers cannot understand why the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) refused to investigate the case. He said, “The CCPC turned a blind eye to the serious competition issues in the Irish market for the purchase of cattle. They effectively washed their hands of the ABP/Slaney deal by leaving it to the Brussels authorities”.
The IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said livestock farmers are extremely concerned over the lack of competition for cattle. “The reality today is farmers are selling at a loss making base price of €3.70/kg, with some factories claiming they cannot take stock for another week, at which point the price may be lower. At the same time, prices for the equivalent beef animals in our main export market in the UK are rising and making £3.64/kg, or €4.30/kg, which is €220 per head more than Irish prices.”
The main conclusion of the PMCA report is that the market for farmers selling cattle is characterised by weak competition and the ABP/Slaney deal is likely to weaken competition even further, through a ‘substantial lessening of competition’ (SLC).
He said the report outlines that the chief concern over the proposed transaction is that it would make co-ordinated effects in the relevant markets more likely. “The report is very clear on the competition concerns in the beef sector, the income pressures that exist for livestock producers and the impact that any weakening of competition would have on their livelihoods.”
The PMCA report pointed out that ABP and Slaney combined currently account for 25.8% of all cattle slaughterings in the state. When the market is narrowed down to premium cattle of steers and heifers meeting the MII grade and weight specifications, this figure rises to 36.2% of cattle. However, the analysis also shows that when the more narrow relevant market of the South Leinster region is used, ABP and Slaney combined would have 44% of the premium cattle kill.
On sheep meat, the report points out that Slaney/ICM is the largest processor of sheep/lamb meat in the State, with around 40% of the kill. The report also raised serious competition concerns over vertical integration including rendering and factory feedlot cattle."

The IFA President was responding to the decision by DG Competition in Brussels today to clear the way for the ABP/Slaney deal.
Joe Healy said farmers cannot understand why the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) refused to investigate the case. He said, “The CCPC turned a blind eye to the serious competition issues in the Irish market for the purchase of cattle. They effectively washed their hands of the ABP/Slaney deal by leaving it to the Brussels authorities”.
Joe Healy said the conclusion by DG Competition that farmers ‘are able to switch slaughterhouses if they can get better prices’ is totally at odds with the reality of the beef trade, where the weekly quotes to farmers show little or no variation. “It also flies in the face of the main conclusion of the PMCA report, which was that the market for cattle is characterised by weak competition and the ABP/Slaney deal is likely to weaken competition even further, through a ‘substantial lessening of competition’ (SLC)”.
The IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the reality today is farmers are being forced to sell at a loss-making base price of €3.70/kg, with factories claiming they cannot take stock for another week, at which point the price may be even lower. At the same time, prices for the equivalent beef animals in our main export market in the UK are rising and making £3.64/kg, or €4.30/kg, which is €220 per head more than Irish prices.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-price-cuts-must-stop/,2016-10-20,Beef Price Cuts Must Stop,"IFA President Joe Healy this week said the beef price cuts at the factories must stop as they are perpetrating serious financial losses on livestock farmers and inflicting permanent damage on the Irish beef sector.
Joe Healy called on the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to immediately convene a meeting of the Beef Forum to address the income crisis situation in the beef sector. He said the excessive factory price cuts have undermined confidence in the sector.
The IFA President said farmers cannot take any more losses and prices must be restored to viable levels. He added that we are now heading into peak demand for the Christmas trade.
“Based on prices in our largest export market in Britain and taking account of the Sterling exchange rate, Irish cattle prices can rise.”
Joe Healy said cattle prices in our main export market in Britain have increased by 41p/kg since May 1st 2016. The R3 steer price in Britain for week ended October 8th was £3.62/kg. At an exchange rate of 90p/€, this price is equivalent to €4.23/kg including VAT. Compared to the official R3 reported Irish price of €3.80/kg for Oct 8th, the British price is 43c/kg above Irish cattle prices or about €160 per head higher.
Joe Healy said IFA representatives are set to meet with factories at local level over the next few days to highlight the rising anger and concern among farmers over loss-making cattle prices.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said Irish cattle prices have fallen from a base of €4.10/4.20/kg (Steers/Heifers) in June (pre-Brexit) to €3.65/3.75/kg. This is a reduction of 45c/kg or about €165 per head and has left beef farmers selling cattle in a serious loss-making situation. Last year, the R3 Bord Bia reported price for week ended October 10th at €4.01/kg including VAT.
Angus Woods pointed out that for week ending 13/10/2016 the average EU R3 steer price was €4.06/kg including VAT and the average EU R3 beef price was €3.78/kg including VAT.
Angus Woods said despite strong market demand at this time, the latest increase in weekly cattle supplies and associated price cuts to unviable levels at the factories highlights again the serious competition and marketing weaknesses in the Irish beef sector.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said another shipment of live cattle set sail to Turkey again this week. He said this shipment involves 3,000 head of younger weanling stock ranging in weights from 250 to 350kgs. IFA is lobbying for another dedicated livestock vessel to be cleared to by the Department of Agriculture so as live export levels can be increased. He said several additional shipments are planned to go to Turkey before Christmas."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-benefit-from-live-exports-as-ship-sails-to-turkey-ifa/,2016-10-20,Farmers Benefit from Live Exports as Ship Sails to Turkey – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said another boat load of 3,300 cattle will sail to Turkey this week, following a boat load of 1,900 cattle exported in late September. He described this as a very positive development for livestock farmers.
Angus Woods said he viewed the loading of the boat, the Atlantic M this week with Charlois, Limousine, Simmental, Angus and Hereford cattle under 12 months of age. He said IFA worked hard to get the live export market to Turkey opened and it is very positive to see ships moving and the benefits being returned to cattle farmers in marts all across the country.
The IFA Livestock leader said the live export trade is essential for competition in the livestock sector and was never needed more at this time of low beef prices and rising cattle numbers.
Angus Woods said Turkey is a major live export market and a great opportunity for the Irish livestock sector. Turkey has an import requirement for 400,000 head of live cattle annually. In 2015, Turkey imported 380,000 head of cattle from Europe and South America. “Turkey is a high volume destination, capable of paying good prices.”
The IFA Livestock leader said it is expected that several more ships loads will sail to Turkey between now and Christmas. He said IFA is lobbying hard for additional ships to be cleared to add to the capacity of the trade and this is expected to happen."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/anger-over-beef-price-cuts-as-ifa-demands-british-retail-price-increases/,2016-10-27,Anger over Beef Price Cuts as IFA Demands British Retail Price Increases,"IFA President Joe Healy said severe cuts in beef prices are imposing serious losses on cattle farmers and inflicting grave damage on the €2.5bn livestock sector. He warned that farmers cannot continue to produce beef at a loss.
Joe Healy said the beef market and price chain is dysfunctional and the power of the retailers, with the collaboration of the factories, is forcing Irish beef prices into unsustainable loss levels. “The British retail price of beef has fallen from £7.05/kg in July 2015 to £6.85/kg in September 2016. If the market was working properly and the 14% devaluation applied, the average retail price would be about £7.80/kg.”
He pointed out that British cattle prices have risen by 41p/kg or 13% since May, while Irish cattle prices have fallen from a base of €4.10/kg in June (pre-Brexit) to €3.65/kg – a reduction of 11%. Joe Healy said it is clear that powerful retailers and weak selling by the Irish factories are forcing Irish beef farmers to take the pain of Brexit, when the British retail price should be rising.
The IFA President said the Irish beef sector, including factories, Minister Creed and Bord Bia, must demand real price increases from British retailers to reflect the devaluation of sterling following the Brexit vote. He said a retail price increase, passed back down the chain to primary producers, would be the normal economic response from a properly functioning market. He pointed out that UK retailers were already having to increase prices in response to demands by suppliers including Unilever and Nestle.
Joe Healy said that, with Brexit, it was never more important for our Government and the EU Commission to tackle the excessive power of the retailers. He said politicians talk and promise a lot on retail regulation but have delivered nothing to curb abuses by retailers.
Joe Healy said there is growing frustration and anger among farmers on beef prices and he warned the factories that the price cuts must stop. He said the severe cuts in beef prices have damaged store and weanling prices and seriously undermined confidence in the sector.
Joe Healy again called on Minister Creed to convene an immediate meeting of the Beef Forum to address the income crisis in the beef sector from the fall in cattle prices and make it clear to both the factories and retailers that beef farmers cannot carry the can for Brexit and the sterling devaluation.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the R3 steer price in Britain for week ended October 15th was £3.61/kg. At an exchange rate of 89.5p/€, this price is equivalent to €4.24/kg including VAT. Compared to the official R3 reported Irish price of €3.79/kg for Oct 16th, the British price is 45c/kg above Irish cattle prices or about €160 per head higher.
Angus Woods said IFA representatives are meeting with factories at local level across the country this week to highlight the rising anger and concern for the future among farmers over loss-making cattle prices.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said another shipment of live cattle sailed to Turkey last week. He said this shipment involved 3,000 head of younger weanling stock, ranging in weight from 250 to 350kgs. A further shipment is planned for later this week, with the ship already in port."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/factory-prices-causing-huge-frustration-among-cattle-farmers/,2016-11-03,Factory Prices Causing Huge Frustration Among Cattle Farmers,"Frustration and anger among beef farmers is very high at the moment, IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said.
“Severe cuts in beef prices are damaging store and weanling prices and seriously undermining confidence in the sector. IFA representatives are meeting with factories at local level across the country to highlight the rising anger and concern for the future among farmers over loss-making cattle prices.”
Angus Woods said despite the weekly kill of the past six weeks running on average at over 4,500 ahead of the same weeks last year – or 65,242 cattle in total ahead of last year – market demand for suitable in-spec cattle is strong.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said factories are eroding the confidence of beef finishers by quoting as low as €3.60/kg and €3.70/kg respectively for steers and heifers while having to pay 5-10c/kg above quotes to secure cattle.
He said €3.65/kg is available throughout the country for steers with up to €3.70/kg paid. €3.75/kg is available for heifers with up to €3.80/kg paid.
The Livestock Chairman said supplies of suitable in-spec cattle are not meeting demand and farmers should not accept the lower and unjustified quotes by factories.
He said in-spec bullocks and heifers are in strong demand from the lucrative UK market where prices continue to outperform what is being paid to Irish farmers. British cattle prices have risen by 41p/kg or 13% since May, while Irish cattle prices have fallen from a base of €4.10/kg in June to €3.60/kg, a reduction of 12%."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-industry-must-insist-on-price-increases-from-uk-retailers/,2016-11-04,Beef Industry Must Insist on Price Increases from Uk Retailers,"IFA President Joe Healy has called on factories to put pressure on UK retailers, insist on higher prices for Irish beef, and pass increases back to farmers.
Joe Healy said, “It is very clear that Irish cattle prices are far below where they should be, based on British prices and the substantial devaluation of Sterling since the June referendum. Farmers are extremely frustrated that they are producing at a loss while price increases from the UK market are both justified and achievable.
“Factories need to recognise that the Irish beef sector is being undermined and put at risk by this market dysfunction. Factories, and all sections of the industry, know there is no future for the Irish beef industry at these prices. They must demand significantly higher prices from their British retailer customers and pass these increases directly back to struggling farmers.
“In a properly functioning market, a retail price increase, passed back down the chain to primary producers, would be the normal economic response to the devaluation of Sterling that has occurred since the Brexit vote. This is exactly what is happening in the case of suppliers such as Unilever and Nestle. Irish beef factories must now follow the example and insist on higher returns.”
The current British retail price of beef is £6.85/kg. If the 14% Sterling devaluation applied, the average retail price would be about £7.80/kg. British cattle prices have risen by 41p/kg or 13% since May, while Irish cattle prices have fallen from a base of €4.10/kg in June (pre-Brexit) to €3.60/kg, a reduction of 12%.
Joe Healy called on Minister Creed to convene an immediate meeting of the Beef Forum and to make it clear to all players that Irish beef farmers cannot be expected to carry the can for Brexit and the Sterling devaluation.
“Factories, Bord Bia and Minister Creed must recognise that Irish farmers cannot take loss making prices for their beef to suit UK retailers. That situation is completely unsustainable, unfair and doing serious damage to our €2.5bn beef sector.
“As we face into the uncertainty of Brexit, it was never more important for our Government and the EU Commission to tackle the excessive power of the retailers. Politicians talk and promise a lot on retail regulation but have delivered nothing to curb abuses by retailers,” Joe Healy said.
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “Frustration and anger among beef farmers is very high at the moment. Severe cuts in beef prices have damaged store and weanling prices and seriously undermined confidence in the sector. IFA representatives are meeting with factories at local level across the country to highlight the rising anger and concern for the future among farmers over loss-making cattle prices.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/cattle-trade-firmer-as-grass-cattle-subside/,2016-11-10,Cattle Trade Firmer as Grass Cattle Subside,"There are clear indications that the cattle trade is firmer this week and may be turning a corner, Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said. 
He said the grass kill has worked through and some factories are finding it more difficult to get stock with base prices of €3.70/kg on steers and €3.80/kg on heifers being secured in places.
Angus Woods said the general base price is €3.65 for steers and €3.75/kg for heifers but farmers are digging in harder and looking for more. He said in the vast majority of cases a decision has now been made to sell or to house and this in itself has tightened numbers and given farmers more bargaining power.

In our main market in the UK, R3 steers are reported at £3.59/kg, which is equivalent to €4.24 at the 89p/€ exchange rate. Angus Woods said the report from the UK is that cattle are a firm trade and they are moving rapidly into the high demand Christmas procurement period. Against this background, it is expected that the trade is likely to pick up.
Angus Woods called on the Irish factories to put pressure on UK retailers, insist on higher prices for Irish beef, and pass increases back to farmers.
“It is very clear that Irish cattle prices are far below where they should be, based on British prices and the substantial devaluation of Sterling since the June referendum. Farmers are extremely frustrated that they are producing at a loss while price increases from the UK market are both justified and achievable.
“Factories and all sections of the industry, know there is no future for the Irish beef industry at the current loss making prices. They must demand significantly higher prices from their British retailer customers and pass these increases directly back to struggling farmers.

He said the loss-making cattle prices this autumn have seriously undermined confidence in the sector.
Joe Healy said, following a request from IFA, Minister Creed has called a meeting of the Forum on Thursday. He said the IFA message to the Forum will be that prices must be restored to viable levels and farmers are not going to continue to produce beef at a loss.
“Factories, and all sections of the industry, know there is no future for the Irish beef industry at current prices. Factories must demand significantly higher prices from their British retailer customers and pass these increases directly back to struggling farmers.”
Joe Healy said it is clear from the experience this autumn, the industry plan to increase cattle numbers will fail the Irish beef sector and especially farmers. “We need to adopt a strategy based on more live exports of calves, weanlings and store cattle to create a better supply/demand balance in the market and more competition.”
He said Minister Creed needs to prioritise market access and especially live export markets to find viable outlets for the increased numbers forecasted in 2017. In addition, the Minister needs to secure a solution to the labelling issues being used to block the live trade to Northern Ireland and Britain.
The IFA President said the Government must pursue all of the national and EU options on support for producers in the context of Brexit implications as well as securing more support for promotion and marketing. He said increasing direct supports to €200 per suckler cow must be a priority. In addition, he added that the issue around Department of Agriculture inspectors permanently monitoring carcase trim in the meat plants must be resolved."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-rising/,2016-11-14,Beef Prices Are Rising This Week,"IFA President Joe Healy said grass cattle supplies are tightening rapidly and, together with the positive change to the sterling exchange rate and strong Christmas market demand, cattle prices are rising.
Farmers selling cattle this week are demanding and getting significant price increases of up to 10c above the quoted prices.
The grass kill has worked through and factories are finding it very difficult to get stock with base prices of €3.70/kg on steers and €3.80/kg on heifers being paid. Some deals above these prices are also on offer.
In the vast majority of cases a decision has now been made to sell or to house and this in itself has tightened numbers and given farmers more bargaining power.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/eu-report-highlights-damage-to-beef-sector-from-trade-agreements-ifa/,2016-11-15,Eu Report Highlights Damage to Beef Sector from Trade Agreements – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman, Angus Woods has said that today’s EU Commission study on the impact of trade agreements on the EU agriculture sector is a major wakeup call and clearly show the damage to the important beef sector from a liberalised trade negotiation.
He said, “The report shows that the value of EU beef production could be reduced by €8bn, with producer price falling by over 15%, in future trade agreements.”
Angus Woods called on the EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Phil Hogan to use the stark findings in the report to redouble his efforts against trade deals that would be bad for beef and Irish and EU agriculture. He said, “Cattle farming is undertaken by 100,000 farmers in Ireland, contributing to economic activity in every parish in the country. The Commissioner must ensure that, in future trade negotiations, the interests of the vitally important beef sector are secured”.
The report conducted by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission estimated the impact of the trade agreements on EU producer prices, production volumes and overall value of the different agriculture sectors.
Angus Woods said the report shows that for the beef sector, trade liberalisation, in the form of a large reduction in tariff barriers, would result in a significant increase in imports (up to 356,000t) and only a very modest increase in exports. He said this would result in price and production cuts for producers and be very damaging for Ireland, where beef is our largest farming enterprise.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said that the report highlights how important it is that meaningful sensitive product status is secured for the beef sector in future negotiations, with limited TRQs and the retention of tariffs on products.
He added “Individual negotiations must take account of the cumulative impact of any previous concessions on market access that have been given in the beef sector.” Angus Woods said it is clear from the analysis that the Mercosur trade deal is the major problem for the beef sector.
He said the report is somewhat restricted in its analysis, in that it takes no account of the impact of Brexit and the UK leaving the EU or the significance of the beef sector to countries such as Ireland and France. He said the reality is that if these aspects were built into the analysis the impact on a country like Ireland would be far greater. He pointed out that a 15% reduction in producer prices would translate to a loss in value for the Irish beef sector of €350m.
The report identified that the dairy sector would gain from the reduction in tariff barriers, with the potential for growth into export markets. However, it would be important that non-tariff barriers, which may prevent real entry into new markets for the EU dairy sector, would also be removed."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/income-crisis-in-livestock-sector-must-be-addressed-ifa-president-at-the-beef-forum/,2016-11-17,Income Crisis in Livestock Sector Must Be Addressed – IFA President at the Beef Forum,"IFA President Joe Healy told Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and the meat factories that the income crisis on livestock farms must be addressed and profitable beef farming is essential for the development of the Irish beef sector. Joe Healy was speaking at a meeting of the Beef Forum chaired by Minister Creed in Dublin today.
The IFA President said, “Growing output alone, without improving incomes on livestock farms is an unsustainable strategy for the Irish beef sector, which is the country’s largest farming sector, worth €2.4bn and involving 80,000 farmers”.
Joe Healy made it clear to the meat factories beef prices must rise. Based on the cost of production, Teagasc has shown that on our most efficient farms, a price of at least €4.00/kg for grass beef and €4.50/kg for winter beef is needed.
The IFA President called on Minister Creed and the Government to mount a strong response at national and EU level to the challenge from Brexit. He said the collapse in beef prices blamed on Brexit is a market disturbance under CAP, similar to the Russian ban, and justifies direct action by the EU Commission.
Joe Healy said, “With the forecast for an additional 100,000 head of cattle next year, a strong live export trade is vital for calves, weanlings, stores and finished cattle. Live exports are essential for competition and to support market balance and viable prices, as well as additional market outlets”. He called on the Department of Agriculture to increase resources and dedicated personnel on market access and to prioritise the live trade. In addition, he said the Minister must work to remove the barriers on the live trade to Northern Ireland and Britain.
The IFA President said direct support for the suckler herd must be increased to €200 per cow in order to maintain our important quality beef herd. An IFA-commissioned study by Professor Alan Renwick from UCD shows that every €1 in direct support to the beef sector underpins €4.28 in output in the economy and all of this remains in rural areas.
Joe Healy told the Beef Forum that Ireland must actively pursue EU regulation to rebalance power in the food chain and ensure a fairer share-out of returns from consumers. This requires full transparency and reporting on prices and margins outside the farmgate and a ban on unfair trading practices, as proposed by this week’s Agricultural Markets Task Force report, commissioned by Commissioner Phil Hogan.
Joe Healy said the EU Commission report on trade deals published this week highlights the devastating impact of further concessions on beef. He said because of the importance of the beef sector in Ireland we are the most exposed EU member state. He said the Government needs to make it clear to Brussels that a Mercosur trade deal is a red line issue and there is no room for any increase in beef imports in TTIP.
The IFA President set out a list of action points for the Beef Forum including outstanding issues from last year on price transparency, specifications, and carcase trim. He said the Department must deliver on the Forum agreement to make Agricultural Officers responsible for monitoring carcase trim in the meat plants."

He said the base price for steers and heifers has increased, with €3.70/3.75 for steers and €3.80/3.85 for heifers.
  Angus Woods said farmers are digging in and demanding more for their cattle, which in turn is leaving many factories with very tight numbers in lairages around the country.
  He said the shift in sterling from 89p back to 86p/€ is worth an additional 15c/kg in returns from the British market. He pointed out that the GB price is £3.61/kg, which is equivalent to €4.41/kg. “With the positive change in sterling and the tighter supply, factories are in a strong position to pay more for cattle.”
  The IFA Livestock Chairman said “Demand for beef in the UK remains very strong. We are in the high demand Christmas procurement period, and trade has picked up. It is simply not acceptable for processors to return an unviable price to our farmers at this time. Prices must be restored to viable levels; factories must demand significantly higher prices from their British retailer customers and pass these increases directly back to farmers”.
  On live exports, Angus Woods said a number of ships are expected to be loaded and sail between now and Christmas. He said the Braham Express will arrive in Ireland today for loading.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/dig-in-for-beef-price-rise-ifa/,2016-11-24,Dig in for Beef Price Rise – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has urged farmers selling cattle to dig in and insist on a substantial price increase from the factories, which are well fit to pay based on stronger Christmas demand and the significant improvement in sterling.
Angus Woods said numbers of in-spec stock have tightened dramatically this week with agents reporting that they cannot get numbers at quoted prices and are having to pay more. Angus Woods said the change in sterling in our main export market from 89p back to 85p/€ is worth 20c/kg in a price improvement.
Angus Woods said the grass cattle are now gone and winter finishers need a substantial price increase to cover costs and move cattle out of sheds. He said traditional winter finishers are not going to feed cattle at a loss and many are considering putting stock to grass next spring. He said beef prices are rising and base prices of €3.70/3.75/kg for steers have been paid this week with €3.80/3.85/kg paid for heifers. He said these prices need to go a lot further in the lead into Christmas.

Beef Challenges 2017 – a major meeting
IFA is holding a major meeting for livestock farmers on Thursday, December 15th in the Tullamore Court Hotel, Tullamore, Co. Offaly.
Speakers will include IFA President Joe Healy, Minister Andrew Doyle, Angus Woods, Livestock Chairman, Cormac Healy, MII, Joe Burke, Bord Bia and Pierce Kelly, Teagasc.
All farmers are encouraged to attend. The meeting starts at 6pm.
Brexit
Angus Woods raised Brexit issues for the beef sector directly with the EU Commission and Commissioner Hogan at sessions in Brussels and the European Parliament this week.
At a meeting with MEPs in the European Parliament on Tuesday evening, Angus Woods said the collapse in beef prices blamed on Brexit is a market disturbance, similar to the Russian ban, and justifies direct action by the EU Commission. He called on the Government to mount a strong campaign at national and EU level to the challenge from Brexit."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-rising-as-supplies-tighten/,2016-12-05,Beef Prices Rising as Supplies Tighten,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said that cattle supply numbers have tightened considerably in the last few days with some factories out of cattle last Thursday/Friday and struggling to get adequate supplies for the kill this week.
Prices have kicked on with farmers insisting on price increases of up to 10c/kg.
Flat prices of €4.00 and €4.05/kg have been paid for Angus stock. In addition , farmers are bargaining and getting flat prices on O grade stock and over 30 month cattle.
The base price on the QPS for steers has also moved up with €3.75/kg now more common and €3.85 for heifers. Cow prices have also kicked on by up to 10c/kg.
In the UK,  the price has moved on with the AHDB reporting the R3 steer price up another 2p/kg at £3.63/kg, which is equivalent to €4.54/kg. With the increase in the British price and the exchange rate at less than 84p/€, there was significant scope for the factories to increase prices.
Against a more positive market background farmers should dig in hard and demand strong price increases from agents and factories. Farmers selling cattle out of sheds need a substantial price rise at this time."

Joe Healy said IFA has organised a top class line-up of speakers, including the Minister of State, Andrew Doyle from the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine. In addition, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods, Meat Industry Ireland Director Cormac Healy, Joe Burke from Bord Bia, Pearse Kelly from Teagasc and IFA Chief economist Rowena Dwyer will address the meeting.
The IFA President said the main topics will include beef supplies and price prospects for 2017, markets for both beef and live cattle and market access issues. He said with 100,000 head of additional beef cattle forecast for 2017, the focus must be on how and where these animals can be sold at viable prices.
Joe Healy said Brexit and the impact it is having on farmers and the beef sector will also be top of the agenda. He said IFA has made it very clear that Brexit is a market disturbance and both the Government and the EU Commission must come forward with a strong response to support farmers.
Other issues which will be discussed at the meeting include CAP and the need for strong direct payments and supports, including increased supports for the suckler herd, tackling low incomes in the livestock sector, the lack of competition and retail power and dominance, as well as the threat from trade deals such as TTIP and Mercosur."

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-demand-strong-action-on-beef-at-tullamore-meeting-including-a-price-increase-for-winter-finishers/,2016-12-16,"IFA Demand Strong Action on Beef at Tullamore Meeting, Including a Price Increase for Winter Finishers","Following the IFA livestock meeting in Tullamore Co Offaly entitled ‘Beef Challenges 2017’, IFA President Joe Healy said based on market returns and the recent positive changes to the sterling exchange rate, the meat factories have major scope to increase beef prices. He said the change in sterling from 89p back to 84p in recent weeks is worth an additional 25c/kg in returns and all of this must be passed back to winter finishers. Joe Healy pointed out factories were quick to inflict price cuts when sterling weakened following the Brexit vote last summer.
The IFA President told the large crowd at the meeting that there is a real income crisis on livestock farms with average incomes at only €12,500 to €16,000. He said cattle prices below the cost of production can’t work.  “Teagasc has made it clear, over and over again, farmers need beef prices of €4.00 to €4.50/kg. For winter finishers, Teagasc has put the breakeven price alone at €4.36/kg for fattening Continental cross cattle this winter.”
  On Brexit, Joe Healy called for a stronger Government response to assist exposed sectors like beef. He said the Brexit and exchange rate impact on beef prices have been severe and farmers have been forced to carry the can through loss making prices all autumn. “Brexit and the beef price fall is a market disturbance. The Government has to take this to Brussels and demand a positive response. This is what happened when Russia closed its borders and Brexit is a lot more serious for Ireland and our beef sector.”
  At the meeting, the IFA President called on Minister Andrew Doyle and his colleague Minister Creed to put a lot more resources and effort into assisting the live export trade. He said with increased cattle numbers forecasted for 2017, farmers need additional outlets and more competition. Joe Healy said IFA worked hard to get the live trade to Turkey going and this has been a life saver for the weanling trade this Autumn. In addition, he said the recent shipment to Libya is also very positive. He said it is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture to ensure Irish farmers and exporters have unrestricted market access for the live cattle to all EU markets including Northern Ireland, Britain and continental Europe.
    Addressing the meeting the IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said IFA has consistently raised farmer concerns about the lack of monitoring on carcase trim in the meat plants. “We are demanding that the Department of Agriculture appoints AOs in each meat plant to be responsible for ensuring that farmers are getting a fair and accurate carcase trim”. He called on the Minister and the Department to fulfil their responsibilities and commitment on this issue. He also called for action on the 30 month age limit.
  Angus Woods said Irish beef farmers are producing to the highest standards in the world. “We have full traceability, we have quality assurance audits and we even have carbon foot-printing on all our beef. This involves major work and costs for farmers. We are meeting every consumer requirement asked of us. In total contrast, the European Commission is pushing to import more and more beef from North and South America, as part of TTIP and Mercosur, which meet none of these standards.” Angus Woods told Minister Doyle that Ireland must strongly reject any more beef imports and make this a red line issue in any trade deal with Mercosur or TTIP.  
  On CAP, Angus Woods said for livestock farmers, strong direct payments are essential. He said the flattening of payments in the Ciolos CAP Reform is proving to be a real income challenge on many livestock farms. “To maintain a strong suckler cow herd, IFA is very clear that we need increased direct supports of €200 per cow, which would put us on a par with the French.” He said coupled supports for vulnerable sectors such as sucklers and sheep are going to play a greater role in the CAP in the future. He called on the Minister to reassess the policy of the Department of Agriculture in this area, adding that with Commissioner Hogan in Brussels, Ireland needs to lead the way on this at European level.
  Angus Woods said ANC, or Disadvantaged area payments, are also very important for livestock farm incomes. He said IFA has launched a strong ANC campaign to retain all areas and reverse the payments cuts. “We will be intensifying this campaign throughout 2017.”

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-president-joe-healy-demands-strong-beef-price-increase/,2017-01-05,IFA President Joe Healy Demands Strong Beef Price Increase,"IFA President Joe Healy has called for a strong beef increase from the factories, saying there was a full clear out of retail beef sales over the holiday period and factories are very anxious for cattle again in the New Year. He said a significant price increase is well justified based on strong demand and improved market and exchange rate returns.
Joe Healy said paid prices at the factories moved in the right direction over the Christmas/New Year period and €3.80/kg base for steers and €3.90/kg base for heifers was freely available and more being paid in places to secure numbers.
He said prices in our main export market in Britain closed the year in a strong position with R3 steers making €3.62/kg and, at the current exchange rate of 85p/€, this is equivalent to a price return of €4.49/kg including VAT at the new higher rate of 5.4% applicable from January 1st.
Joe Healy said as well as the strong price returns in the UK, the positive change in the Sterling exchange rate from 89p in October/November back to 85p/€ currently is worth an additional 21c/kg in returns and leaves the factories in a strong position to increase prices to farmers.
Joe Healy said the factories have fallen well behind on price with the Irish price now below the EU average and a very wide gap opening up with prices in our main export market in Britain.
The IFA President said winter finishers need a strong price lift as selling cattle out of sheds involves very high costs and at current prices these farmers are encountering serious losses.
Live Exports
On live exports, Joe Healy said IFA has been working hard on calf exports for next spring and has met a number of the exporters and the Department of Agriculture in recent weeks. He said a strong live export trade for calves is essential for competition and to maintain a supply/demand balance in the Irish beef sector capable at delivering viable prices to farmers.
Joe Healy said IFA had met with the Department of Agriculture on calf sales and exports for 2017 and requested that the Department of Agriculture reduce the fees of up to €7.00 per head charged on calf exports. He said the charges made up of Department of Agriculture inspection and disease levies, as well as Bord Bia charges, are way too high relative to the value of the calf. He said it is completely unfair that a calf worth between €80 and €150 per head would have to pay the same level of charge as a finished animal going through a meat plant worth €1,400 per head.
The IFA leader said IFA also met with Cork Marts, and while it was disappointing they were exiting the trade, the group have made some changes which will facilitate the sale and export of calves in 2017.
He said Cork Marts have agreed to provide a rebate of €1.50 per head to purchasers who buy over 100 calves in their group. In addition, they will reduce the costs on sellers by over half from €6.50 to €3.00 per head on up to 50 calves.
Joe Healy said IFA had worked hard in opening up the live export trade to Turkey this year and this had proved critical to the weanling trade throughout last autumn. He said a boat load of weanlings sailed to Turkey at the end of December.
The IFA President said it is vitally important that Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and his Department ensures that a strong live export trade to Turkey and other Middle East and North African destinations continues into 2017."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-calls-for-a-major-push-on-live-export-trade/,2017-01-06,IFA Calls for a Major Push on Live Export Trade,"Speaking at a Bord Bia/Department of Agriculture seminar for live exporters in Tullamore this week, IFA President Joe Healy called for a major national diplomatic initiative to be led by the Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed to maximise every single market opportunity on live exports in 2017.
The IFA President said, “It is clear that there are real opportunities for Ireland in the live export markets such as Turkey, North Africa and continental Europe and all of these must be actively pursued in 2017.”
Against a background of increased cattle supplies of 100,000 head forecast for 2017 and a continuing increase in calf supplies, Joe Healy said we need to get the capacity of the live trade back up to 300,000 to 400,000 head to drive competition and get a balance back into the beef trade capable of delivering viable prices from the market.
Joe Healy said the live trade needs more support. The charges on the live trade are way too high and IFA is demanding that the fees of up to €8.00 per head charged on calf exports be removed. He said the charges made up of Department of Agriculture inspection (€4.80) and disease levies (€1.27), as well as Bord Bia (€1.90) charges, are way too high relative to the value of the calf. He said it is completely unfair that a calf worth between €80 and €150 per head would have to pay the same level of charge as a finished animal going through a meat plant worth €1,400 per head.
Joe Healy said IFA has been working hard on calf exports for the spring and has met a number of the exporters and the Department of Agriculture in recent weeks. He said a strong live export trade for calves is essential, adding that the current difficulties in exporting to Holland are very unsatisfactory and need to be resolved immediately with the EU Commission. Irish farmers must have access to the EU single market.
Joe Healy said IFA worked hard in opening up the live export trade to Turkey in 2016 and this had proved critical to the weanling trade throughout last autumn. He said it is essential that the trade to Turkey is vibrant again in 2017. Other international live export markets with significant potential include Egypt, Libya, Algeria and Morocco.
On boats, Joe Healy said IFA is pushing for more designated boats to be approved for the live trade out of Ireland. He said currently there are four boats cleared to sail and another boat is set to be inspected next week. In addition, there are three more boats lined up for approval and these are essential to service the new and developing live export markets emerging.
The IFA President also called for the restrictions on labelling being used to inhibit and block the vitally important live trade to Northern Ireland and Britain must be resolved. He said it is totally unacceptable that processors and retailers are allowed to stymie a trade by unfairly using EU labelling legislation.
In conclusion, the IFA President said it is vitally important that Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and his Department ensures that a strong live export trade to Turkey and other Middle East and North African destinations continues into 2017."
https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/farmers-have-borne-the-brunt-of-sterling-weakness-healy/,2017-01-11,Farmers Have Borne the Brunt of Sterling Weakness – Healy,"Reacting to the Bord Bia Export Performance and Prospects Report, IFA President Joe Healy pointed out that it is mainly Irish farmers who have borne the pain of sterling weakness through lower prices, particularly for beef and mushrooms.
IFA estimates that beef farmers have taken a hit of €150m in price cuts in 2016 as a result of the sterling devaluation. This decrease largely occurred following the UK referendum decision in June and the sharp devaluation in sterling. Joe Healy said for farmers, this meant a drop of €100/head on prime beef cattle in the autumn, with a knock on impact for store and weanling producers.
Mushroom growers have seen the price paid to them fall by an estimated €15m over the last 12 months, in many cases wiping out their entire margins.
Joe Healy said the figures also highlight the inability of processors and exporters to secure price increases from retailers as a result of the decline in sterling. This situation underlines the excessive control of retailers over the food chain and their power to dictate lower prices back to processors and farmers, instead of paying higher prices to compensate for sterling weakness.
The IFA President emphasised that farmers were taking these losses as a direct result of the Brexit referendum, which was a political decision totally outside their control. This cannot be ignored by politicians here and in Europe."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-trade-finely-balanced-as-farmers-demand-price-increase-ifa/,2017-01-16,Beef Trade Finely Balanced as Farmers Demand Price Increase – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the beef trade is finely balanced. He said the full sale and clear out of the chills during the holiday period has left a strong demand for in-spec stock. In addition he said the strong demand for cows indicates in-spec prime cattle are scarce and factories need the numbers to meet market demand.
Angus Woods said winter finishers need a strong price increase. He said feeding costs are much higher this time of year and the factories know the price has to rise. He added based on market returns and especially the very strong price in our largest export market in the UK, where R3 steers are making the equivalent of €4.35/kg, there was significant scope for factories to increase prices.
The IFA Livestock leader said steers are making a base price of €3.75/3.80 and heifers are on €3.85/3.90. He said some deals for heifers had been done at €3.95/kg with some deals on transport costs in places. He said last week kill was 32,119 with some factories finding it very difficult to get cattle especially over the weekend and early today.
He said the cow trade has lifted with €3.05/kg for P grades, €3.20 for O grades, €3.40 for Rs and €3.50 for U grades. He said this was a positive sign and an indication that in-spec stock are tight and they need numbers to meet market demand."

In 2017, Joe Healy said IFA will also be focussed on the review of the ANC and the opening of the CAP post-2020 negotiations, together with commodity prices and profitability in all sectors.
The IFA President also welcomed Damian McDonald, who takes over as Director General of the IFA at the close of today’s AGM from Acting General Secretary Bryan Barry. Joe Healy said his appointment is part of the ongoing renewal of IFA.
Read the full speech by IFA President Joe Healy to the IFA AGM
Brexit
Joe Healy said with 40% of our food exports going to the UK, no other member state and no other sector are as exposed in these negotiations. “Agriculture and food cannot become a battleground between Brussels and London. There are too many farm livelihoods and jobs at stake. Politics cannot be allowed override our fundamental economic interests.”
He said farmers expect the Taoiseach and the Irish Government to use the strong relationship they have with both EU and UK leaders to influence a constructive approach to these difficult negotiations. “In Brussels, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Phil Hogan, must make the retention of free trade in agriculture and food products between the EU and UK a priority.”
The IFA President stressed that politicians in Dublin and Brussels cannot ignore the ongoing impact of the sterling devaluation, and direct aid for the farmers and sectors affected must be on the agenda.
“Farmers have taken most of the pain resulting from the weakness of sterling. Beef farmers took a hit of €150m last year from this alone and mushroom growers saw their margins wiped out. These losses are a direct result of a political decision outside farmers’ control and cannot be tolerated.”
Joe Healy also warned politicians against any reduction in the CAP budget as a result of Brexit, saying if EU solidarity means anything, then the budget shortfall must be made good so that farmers are not hit with CAP cuts when the UK leaves.
Farm Incomes & Other Priorities
The IFA President said he had identified farm incomes and prices as his key priority when he was elected last April and that focus remains for 2017. He said co-ops must deliver a substantial price increase and reach at least 33 cent per litre ahead of the Spring peak. With cattle supplies forecast to increase by 100,000 head, Minister Creed must prioritise a strong live export trade.
IFA’s campaign on the ANC review is up and running. Our priorities for this vital income support for farmers are:
Protection of all areas currently designated,
Reversal of cuts and restoration of funding to 2008 levels, and
Payment rates that reflect the natural handicap
IFA will be escalating our campaign through intensive lobbying of TDs and Senators in the coming months.
With the opening of discussions on the next CAP, Joe Healy said the CAP post-2020 must work for Irish farmers. At the heart of the IFA campaign will be a strong CAP budget, with direct payments supporting active farmers, and a well-funded Rural Development Programme.
Following another very difficult year for grain growers, IFA has made a strong case for an aid package for tillage growers who suffered severe weather losses last harvest. Joe Healy called on Minister Creed to immediately make available funding of €4m for these farmers as there is no excuse for any further delay on this decision.
Joe Healy said he had a strong message for both the banks and agencies dealing with distressed loans. We will not tolerate the ‘vulture fund approach’ of stripping assets, with no regard for the family farm.
IFA Renewal
Joe Healy said substantial progress has been made on the renewal of IFA. Under the chairmanship of Teddy Cashman, the Lucey Implementation Committee identified improvements covering the key issues of governance, transparency and IFA Income and Financing.
Joe Healy said he was delighted to introduce the new Director General, Damian McDonald who brings with him a strong reputation for successful management of organisations, both with Horse Sport Ireland and, previously, with Macra na Feirme. He has also worked with IFA, and has a great knowledge of the issues facing farming in Ireland today. He wished Damian McDonald well and assured him of Council’s full support as he takes on this challenging role.
Concluding his address, Joe Healy said farmers need a strong IFA to fight for viable farm incomes. We achieved a lot for farmers in 2016. Together we can tackle the challenges of 2017 head on and deliver real results for farmers."

Angus Woods said some cattle are moving today above these prices with €3.85 paid on steers and €3.95 equivalent paid on heifers. In addition, he said factories are covering transport and clipping charges in places to get stock.
Angus Woods said finishers are looking for a price increase as at current prices they are well below break-even.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said bulls are making €3.70/3.80/3.90 for Os/Rs/Us. Cows are in strong demand with prices ranging from €3.05 for P+ to €3.45 and tops of €3.50 for quality U grade cows."

He said deals at the higher end as well as transport and clipping charges are quite common, reflecting the strong demand for cattle. He added that some cattle were moving today above a base of €3.85 on steers and above €3.95 on heifers.
Angus Woods said finishers are looking for a price increase as at current prices they are well below break-even.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said bulls are making €3.65/3.80/3.90 for Os/Rs/Us. Cows continue in strong demand with prices ranging from €3.05 for P+ to €3.45 and tops of €3.50 for quality U grade cows.
Angus Woods pointed out that the average factory price paid for week ended January 22nd, recorded by the Department of Agriculture, reflects the fact that the factories are paying well above the quoted base price. He said the average steer R3 price was €3.88/kg and the average heifer R3 grade price was €4.01/kg including bonuses. However, he pointed out that these are the average prices and half of the cattle sold are achieving prices higher than those outlined by the DAFM."

He said there is solid market demand, particularly from the UK, with factories shifting numbers and no back up of beef in the system. He added that the last kill figures for week ending Feb 5th was 34,214.
Angus Woods said UK prices continue in their strong position of with prices for R3 steers at £3.60/kg for week ending Feb 5th, which is equivalent to €4.34/kg, confirming the strong view that there is real potential for Irish factories to lift prices to winter finishers based on solid demand and UK market returns. Angus Woods said winter finishers desperately need a kick on in prices at this stage in the season and the factories needed to respond positively.
The IFA Livestock leader said the official Department of Agriculture prices for week ending Feb 5th show that the average price paid for R steers was €3.89/kg and for heifers was €4.01/kg. He pointed out that these prices included bonuses but are the average meaning that the factories actually paid more for half of the cattle purchased.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-in-brussels-on-beef-markets-brexit-and-brazil/,2017-04-07,"IFA in Brussels on Beef Markets, Brexit and Brazil","Speaking at the EU Commission Civil Dialogue Meeting in Brussels on beef this week, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the prospects for the EU beef market for 2017 look more positive than 2016. He said the latest forecast results on beef, presented at the Civil Dialogue Meeting show that EU production is set to fall and prices are forecasted to rise in 2017.
In addition, he said the EU Commission are predicting that the strong trade balance of exports over imports will increase in 2017, driven by continued growth in live exports, mainly to Turkey.
Angus Woods said the 2016 figures show that beef production increased by 2.6%, driven by a 7% increase in cull cow slaughterings as a result of the fallout from the dairy sector, which caused the beef price problems in 2016. EU beef prices fell by about 15c/kg in 2016 over 2015 levels. For 2017, the EU is forecasting that beef production will fall by 0.25% or over 20,000t and both male and female cattle prices are forecast to increase.
On EU exports, Angus Woods said the Commission pointed out export volumes were up 18% at 702,337t. The biggest export market was Turkey, taking 10% or 71,200t, the majority of which was live cattle. He said the EU Commission highlighted the importance of live trade to Turkey, describing it as a vital value added market outlet. Live cattle exports make up 52% of the total value of EU beef exports.
Brexit impact
Angus Woods said IFA highlighted the impact of Brexit on the Irish beef sector, pointing out that in the second half of 2016 producers took a price hit of €150m, mainly as a result of the Sterling devaluation.
He said IFA make it clear at the meeting that no other Member State, and no other sector, is as exposed in Brexit negotiations. The UK is our closet market, of high value, with similar preferences. He said the IFA has identified that, if the UK exits the Single Market and Customs Union, there must be a Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the EU and UK, which would include the following specific elements: Tariff-free trade for agricultural products and food, maintenance of equivalent standards on food safety, animal health, welfare and the environment, and the application of the Common External Tariff for imports to both the EU and UK.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said the UK is the market for 50% of Irish beef exports. “It’s a high-value market and consistently pays above the EU average. Any reduction in access to, or the value of, the UK market would have a very negative impact on the Irish beef sector, and potentially the overall European beef market.”
Brazilian Meat Scandal
On the Brazilian Meat scandal, Angus Woods said IFA made it absolutely clear to the EU Commission that they must take stronger action against Brazil.
The IFA Livestock leader said the latest reports from Brazil clearly indicate that basic requirements around standards, traceability and food safety are still not being met in Brazil. He pointed out that it is nearly 10 years since IFA uncovered serious failures in the way the authorities monitor and oversee the implementation of standards in Brazil that are the norm for European farmers and the food industry.
Under questioning on the EU audits in Brazil, the Commission said they will agree to undertake a series of additional FVO audits on the meat sector in Brazil commencing next month. Angus Woods said these audits need to be thorough, get to the real truth with clear and decisive follow up action."
https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/politicians-must-put-farming-top-of-brexit-agenda/,2017-04-24,Joe Healy’s Address to IFA Brexit Event,"Read the full speech by IFA President Joe Healy at the IFA Brexit Event
Commissioner Hogan, thank you for giving us a clearer picture of the current EU position in the Brexit negotiations.
We are fortunate to have an Irish Commissioner in the agriculture portfolio facing into these critical negotiations.
Commissioner, I know your job is to represent Europe’s farmers across all 27 Member States.
But I want you to know that Irish farmers – not only in this room, but right across the country – are depending on you to protect their interests at this critical time.
You and your colleagues cannot allow our livelihoods to be destroyed as a result of Brexit.
How can you safeguard us? Three things are needed.
 The closest possible trading relationship between the EU and the UK;
The value of the UK market must be maintained; and
A fully-funded CAP must be secured.
And why is this so important? Farming and agri-food is the backbone of the Irish economy.
Last year, our food and drink exports topped €11bn.
Farming and food generates economic activity in every parish, village and town across Ireland, supporting 300,000 jobs directly and indirectly.
That’s what’s at stake in the Brexit negotiations.
That’s why farmers from all sectors and all parts of Ireland have come here today.
To stand up and challenge our political leaders, in Dublin and Brussels, to fight for our livelihoods.
Why Brexit matters for agriculture
The implications of Brexit for Ireland are clear – and they are stark.
Ireland is the most exposed EU Member State, and the stakes are highest in our farming and food sector.
40%, or €4bn of our exports go to the UK each year – that’s 50% of our beef, 1/3 of our dairy, over half of our pigmeat exports, and more than 90% of all Irish mushroom exports.
The border creates serious challenges.
Every year, thousands of animals and huge volumes of agricultural produce cross the border to Northern Ireland for further finishing or processing, as part of a highly integrated supply chain.
These trading links have built up over many years and are critically important for farmers and processors on both sides of the border.
Brexit presents a real risk of a ‘hard’ border, with customs checks and other controls.
This would seriously disrupt trade and have a severe impact on the daily lives and businesses of farmers, particularly those in Border Counties.
We cannot allow that to happen.
Let’s look at the CAP
Defending the European model of farming is a cornerstone of the Common Agricultural Policy.
The EU applies tariffs on imports from non-EU countries to protect the market for European farmers.
A cheap food policy in the UK would fatally undermine Irish and EU exports and hit farmer prices.
We cannot allow that to happen.
The UK is a net contributor to the CAP budget.
Farmers across all sectors, particularly in the drystock sectors, are hugely dependent on direct payments.
Commissioner, I want to tell you plainly here.
Irish farmers don’t want to hear any talk of CAP cuts.
Specific threats
I want to highlight some of the specific issues for our main sectors.
For the beef sector, the threat from Brexit is frightening.
The UK is the market for 50% or 270,000 tonnes of Irish beef exports.
IFA strongly supports efforts to secure new markets for Irish beef.
However, the reality is that any damage to our position on the UK market would see significant displacement of Irish beef onto EU markets, such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.
This would destabilise the EU beef market, undermining price returns to farmers not just in Ireland but across Europe.
In the dairy sector, one third of our exports go to the UK.
It’s our main market for cheddar. There is no alternative.
A loss of access to the UK market would destabilise the overall dairy sector here.
Brexit also presents a particular threat for milk processors depending on an all-Ireland milk pool.
The same goes for the pigmeat and poultry sectors, where large volumes of product are moving across the border for processing.
In the sheep sector, the key issue is the future destination of large volumes of New Zealand lamb imports.
Across virtually every sector in agriculture, from beef, dairy and lamb, to mushrooms and forestry, there is a real threat from
• reduced access to the UK market through tariff barriers
• a loss in the value of the UK market through increased low cost imports and
• the potential reduction in the CAP budget post Brexit
The ESRI has estimated that WTO tariff rates would virtually wipe out agri-food trade to the UK, with losses of over €2b for our meat and dairy exports.
At farm level, Teagasc looked at the impact a ‘hard’ Brexit would have on farm incomes, in a scenario where there is a 10% reduction in the CAP budget and lower UK food prices.
Farming would be devastated, with average incomes falling by 26%. Cattle farm incomes would be worst hit, dropping by a massive 37%.
That would devastate suckler beef production in Ireland.
We’re talking about the livelihoods of the 100,000 farmers involved in livestock and beef, and thousands of jobs in beef processing and related sectors.
IFA Priorities
Since the UK vote, IFA has campaigned to highlight the significant threats posed to Irish farming from Brexit.
We have produced a comprehensive policy document which analyses what is at stake and sets out the solutions that are required.
We have engaged with politicians here and in Brussels.
We met the EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier. He had our document. He has read it and he knows our issues.
We met the Taoiseach Enda Kenny & Ministers Creed and Flanagan. I have also met the UK ambassador to Ireland Robin Barnett and other EU Government representatives.
IFA is actively working with European farming organisations to highlight the damage a hard Brexit could do to Europe’s €45bn worth of food exports to the UK.
We are also in close contact with our colleagues in the UFU and NFU, who share many of the same concerns about the impact of Brexit.
I want to welcome Martin Merrild, President of COPA, the European Farmers’ Union, and UFU President, Barclay Bell, both of whom will speak later today.
IFA is determined that farming and food is top of the Brexit agenda, not only in Ireland, but at EU level. For the simple reason that farming supports 44 million jobs across the EU.
Commissioner, Europe’s strategic objective in these negotiations must be to maximise the future value of the EU farming and food sector.
IFA is very clear on what this means.
Number one: it means maintaining the closest possible trading relationship between the UK and EU, while preserving the value of the UK market.
The UK is proposing “a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement … [that] covers sectors crucial to our linked economies”. Such an agreement must be in both sides’ interests.
In the agri-food sector, tariff-free trade between the UK and the EU alone does not go far enough.
The value of our exports cannot be undermined by an increase in low cost food imports into the UK market or by imports that do not meet the high food safety, animal welfare, health and environmental standards that are required of EU producers.
Any Free Trade Agreement must include the maintenance of European standards and the UK’s acceptance of the European Common External Tariff to protect the market against low cost imports.
I want to put it very plainly; cheaply-produced beef from Brazil and other Mercosur countries cannot be allowed onto British supermarket shelves alongside our high-quality beef.
Our second requirement is a Strong CAP budget following the UK’s departure
Commissioner, Irish farmers are already struggling with the erosion of the Basic Payment.
Many farmers in this room are up in arms over the cuts in their payments introduced in the Ciolos reform.
We need an increase in the CAP budget in the next reform.
And Commissioner, if the Brexit negotiations go wrong for Irish agriculture, farmers must be compensated directly for the damage caused
Let me deal with some other issues
Farmers, processors and the wider agri-food sector have invested a lot in building market share in the UK. We cannot afford to lose it.
We have been struggling to cope with the devaluation of Sterling over the past year. In the event of any further significant drop, farmers and the food sector will require direct support through CAP market supports, and flexibility on State Aid rules.
We also want increased resources for market access and promotion for relevant bodies, including the Department of Agriculture and Bord Bia.
Finally, to minimise uncertainty during the negotiation process, discussions on the future EU-UK framework must commence early in the withdrawal discussions.
Conclusion
Ladies and Gentlemen, Brexit is the greatest threat to Irish farming in our lifetimes.
The livelihoods of thousands of farm families and the future of the agriculture and food industry are at stake in these negotiations.
Today, I have set out the imperatives for Irish farmers and the agri-food sector in the Brexit negotiations.
There is a huge responsibility on both EU and UK politicians to get this right.
Minister Creed and the Irish Government must ensure that farming and agri-food issues, are top of the EU’s Brexit agenda.
Commissioner, the ball is about to be thrown in on the Brexit negotiations. And to put it plainly, this is senior hurling.
This is about Europe showing its commitment to Irish farming.
It’s about jobs.
It’s about rural communities.
It’s about farm families
Commissioner, Ireland’s farmers expect you to deliver.

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-on-the-up/,2017-05-18,Cattle Prices on the Up,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said cattle price are increasing again this week, with reports of €4.10 to as high as €4.20 base offered for steers and €4.20 to €4.30 offered for heifers.
In addition he said €4.15 base has been paid for bulls and prices of €4.10/4.20 for R/U grades are common. He said finished cattle supplies have tightened dramatically in the last two weeks and factories are scrambling to get adequate supplies to meet strong market demand.
The Livestock leader said UK beef price has increased again by 3p/kg in the last week and this is the sixth successive week of price rises. UK prices are now 41p/kg above last year’s levels. Current UK prices are £3.62/kg, which is equivalent to €4.43/kg including VAT. “This positive momentum in our largest export market provides significant scope for factories to lift prices further here,” Angus Woods said.
The official Department of Agriculture reported prices for week ending May 7th show that the average R3 steer price was €4.19/kg and the average R3 heifer price was €4.31/kg. Young bulls are making €4.19 for Us, €4.11 for Rs and €3.91/kg for O grades. Angus Woods said Cows are also a good trade with €3.68/kg for Rs, €3.47 for Os and €3.41/kg for P+ grades.
Live exports
On live exports, Angus Woods said the trade remains buoyant with total live exports reaching over 105,000 head. This is an increase of over 31,000 head on last year and reflecting a 42% increase.
He said this is due mainly to a strong calf export trade to the EU as a result of IFA work in reducing charges on exports. In addition, he said the live export trade is strongly boosted by the exports to Turkey where he said two ships have already sailed and another is due to load again next week.
Angus Woods said the Express 1 boat is loading for Libya this week and another boat is on the way to Ireland to load for Turkey."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/strong-cattle-trade-evident/,2017-05-25,Strong Cattle Trade Evident,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said the cattle trade remains reasonably strong with the base price for steers at €4.10 and some top prices of €4.15/4.20. He said heifers have improved in price with €4.30/kg a more common base but prices ranging from €4.20 to €4.30.
On numbers, he said the weekly kill is running at 31,500 head but demand is very strong and there is not an ounce of beef in stock. He said the UK market continues to improve with very strong demand. UK prices of £3.64/kg are equivalent to €4.45/kg including VAT.
On live exports, Angus Woods said it is very positive to see another boat back in again to load for Turkey. He said it is essential for competition that a strong and vibrant live export trade is maintained through the summer and export numbers increase as we approach the second half of the year."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/cattle-trade-remains-strong/,2017-05-29,Cattle Trade Remains Strong,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said the cattle trade remains reasonably strong with the base price for steers at €4.15/kg and some top prices of €4.20 paid.
He said heifers have improved in price with €4.30/kg a more common base but prices ranging from €4.25 to €4.35.
On numbers, he said the weekly kill is running at about 30/31,000 head but demand is very strong and there is not an ounce of beef in stock. He said the UK market continues to improve with very strong demand. UK prices of £3.64/kg are equivalent to €4.45/kg including VAT.
International view 
On the international beef trade, Angus Woods said beef prices in the main producing continents are very strong with US and Canadian prices at €4.45/4.50/kg. Australian prices are also a historic high levels at €3.52/kg and some of the south American power houses also very strong with Uruguay at €3.41/kg and Argentina at €3.25/kg, all exclusive of VAT.
Live exports
On live exports, Angus Woods said it is very positive to see another boat back in again to load for Turkey. He said it is essential for competition that a strong and vibrant live export trade is maintained through the summer and export numbers increase as we approach the second half of the year."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-trade-remains-strong/,2017-06-03,Beef Trade Remains Strong,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said the cattle trade remains strong with the base price for steers at €4.15/kg and some top prices of €4.20 paid.

Angus Woods said a concerted move by the factories to pull cow prices has not succeeded with plants having to pay last week prices to get numbers. In addition, he said farmers have the option of selling in the marts where the trade is very strong."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/live-exports-up-43-on-last-year/,2017-06-03,Live Exports Up 43% on Last Year,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said live exports are performing well this year and providing a major boost to cattle farmers.
He said a total of 116,000 head of livestock have already been exported up to May 20th, an increase of 43% on last year. Angus Woods said the benefit of every one of these exports has been reflected in higher and more competitive cattle prices in marts all across the country.
IFA is totally committed to maintaining a strong live export trade, which Angus Woods said is essential for price competition and providing market outlets for livestock. He also welcomed the strong commitment Agriculture Minister Michael Creed has shown to live exports. He said, “It is essential that the Government and the Department of Agriculture have a positive policy towards the live export trade and ensure that it is regulated in a proper and practical way, which maximises its potential and fully protects the trade.”
The IFA Livestock leader said that more than 85,000 calves have been exported this year, mainly male Holstein Friesian, with the main markets being the Netherlands and Spain. He said almost 40,000 head have gone to the Netherlands and a further 36,000 to Spain.
Reduced charges
Angus Woods said the IFA campaign early this year, which succeeded in reducing the charges on calf exports by over €1,100 per load, was a major factor in ensuring a strong calf trade this spring. He also acknowledged the support of Minister Creed who reduced the Department of Agriculture charges from €4.80 to €1.20 per calf. He added IFA had worked closely with the Department of Agriculture and exporters in improving welfare and transport conditions for calf exports to the EU.
On international live exports, Angus Woods said it is very encouraging to see designated live export ships regularly loading in Irish ports this spring. He said to date, four loads of cattle have been shipped with many more planned for the summer and into the back end of the year. Three boat loads have been shipped to Turkey and a further boat load to Libya.
Angus Woods said IFA worked hard in getting the Turkish market opened for live exports and it was now very positive to see boats sailing regularly, bringing strong competition to the ring side in marts all across the country. He said at present Purcell Bros., who have a contract for 20,000 cattle to Turkey, have the Atlantic M on the seas with 3,000 bulls on board. Last year, the Co Meath based exported Viastar shipped over 19,000 cattle to Turkey. The Limerick/Kerry based Hallissey group also sent a boat load to Turkey, earlier this year. Supreme Livestock recently sent a boat load of 1,850 bulls to Libya.
Welfare
The IFA Livestock leader strongly defended the animal welfare aspects of the live export trade. He said all live exports are fully certified by Department of Agriculture veterinary inspectors, who pay particularly attention to animal health and welfare.
In addition, Angus Woods said Teagasc has proved scientifically that there is no adverse effect on the welfare of livestock from the proper transportation of livestock from Ireland to the Middle East.
He cited a major Teagasc study undertaken by Dr Bernadette Early MRCVS on the transport of 120 young bulls during an 11 day journey to the Lebanon. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of sea transport on the physiological, behavioural and performance responses of young bulls. The conclusion of the comprehensive peer reviewed study was that the welfare of young bulls transported by sea journey was not adversely affected.
Egypt market
Angus Woods said IFA is pushing hard for the opening up of the live export trade to Egypt. He said this would be a major boost to the Irish livestock and beef sector. He said IFA has requested the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to lead a trade delegation to Egypt to assist with the reopening of the trade, adding that the Egyptian market is a major importer of live cattle.
The IFA Livestock Leader said IFA has a very strong policy regarding payment for livestock. He said the IFA advice is very clear. Sell you livestock in your local mart where payment is guaranteed. Selling finished cattle to a factory insist on payment on the day."

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/strong-beef-prices-driven-by-strong-market-demand-ifa/,2017-06-15,Strong Beef Prices Driven by Strong Market Demand – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said beef prices are holding firm, driven by extremely strong market demand and rising prices in our main export market in the UK.
He said UK prices have risen each week for the last 10 weeks in a row by over 16c/kg. He said these price increases, which are continuing strongly, outweigh any change in the sterling exchange rate.
  In addition, he said beef demand across all other markets is also very strong and there is not a kilo of beef in store anywhere.
  Angus Woods said steers are on a base of €4.20 and €4.30 on heifers. In some cases, more than €4.30 has been paid to get stock, with paid base prices of €4.32 and €4.33 for heifers.
  Angus Woods said lighter carcase weights and a strong live export trade will help to negate the impact of higher numbers for the second half of the year.
  UK cattle prices are up 13p/kg or 16c/kg since April 1st. UK prices are running 40p/kg or 48c/kg ahead of this time last year.
  UK cattle prices (R3) steers are £3.68, which is equivalent to €4.40/kg incl VAT, at an exchange of 88p/€.
  Irish slaughterings are running 27,000 head above last year.
  Despite higher numbers, carcase weights are down this year. For the first four months of the year, steer weights are back 9.6kg.
  In addition, live exports are very strong this year, up 35,000 head at 116,000 head. Over 90,000 calves have been exported and exports to Turkey are also very strong with one exporter currently filling a contract for 20,000 head. It is expected there will be further contracts as the year progresses.
  Grass growth is very strong and cattle are thriving well."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/seven-reasons-why-farmers-should-resist-factory-pressure-on-cattle-prices/,2017-06-19,Seven Reasons Why Farmers Should Resist Factory Pressure on Cattle Prices,"IFA President Joe Healy said there is no market basis for pressure on cattle prices at this time. He said the move by the factories to pull quotes and talk down the trade is an attempt to force out very tight supplies of prime cattle.
The IFA President said prices in our main market in the UK continue to rise and the factories are finding it very difficult to get adequate numbers of prime cattle to fill very strong market demand.
Steer base prices are currently €4.10/4.15/kg and heifers are €4.20/4.25/kg, with some top prices of €4.30 paid.
UK cattle prices are up 14p/kg or 17c/kg since April 1st. UK prices are running 40p/kg or 48c/kg ahead of this time last year.
UK cattle prices (R3) steers are £3.70, which is equivalent to €4.48/kg incl vat at an exchange of 87p/€.
Irish slaughterings are running 30,209 head above last year.
Despite numbers being higher, carcase weights are down this year. For the first four months, steer weights are back 9.6kg.
In addition, live exports are very strong this year, up 35,000 head at 116,000 head. Over 90,000 calves have been exported and exports to Turkey are also very strong. Purcells currently are filling a contract for 20,000 head. It is expected there will be further contracts as the year progresses.
Grass growth is very strong and cattle are thriving well, with no pressure on farmers to sell.

IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said lighter carcase weights and a strong live export trade will help to negate the impact of higher numbers for the second half of the year."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-should-strongly-resist-the-lower-unjustified-quotes-on-offer-from-factories-ifa/,2017-06-29,Farmers Should Strongly Resist the Lower Unjustified Quotes on Offer from Factories,"IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman Angus Woods said the lower quotes offered by meat factories this week are not reflective of the strong market sentiment that exists in the UK and EU beef markets.
He said supplies of prime beef cattle in Britain are extremely tight, back by almost 10% last week. As a result, prices have continued to strengthen, rising by over 6c/kg over the course of the week.
Angus Woods said, “The lighter carcase weights this year, the strong live export trade to international markets and the increased kill to-date with the drop in slaughterings in Britain all contribute to less beef being available and provide very favourable market conditions for our beef”.
He said there is no backlog of beef in store and supplies of in-spec cattle on the ground are not meeting factory demand to fill the deficit in the UK supply. This is very evident from the level of factory agent activity in trying to secure cattle for immediate slaughter. Good grass growth and cattle thriving well is allowing farmers to strongly resist the current price pressure.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said there is clearly no market basis for pressure on cattle prices at the moment and this move by the factories to pull quotes and talk down the trade is an attempt to force out very tight supplies of prime cattle by undermining confidence.
Angus Woods said steers are being bought this week in general at a base price of €4.05/kg, but ranging from €4.00 to €4.10/kg. Heifers are generally making €4.15/kg as a base price but ranging from €4.10 to €4.20/kg. He said factories are reluctant to leave cattle behind and farmers should strongly resist the lower unjustified quotes on offer."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-makes-strong-case-on-beef-to-minister-creed-and-factories-at-forum/,2017-07-13,IFA Makes Strong Case on Beef to Minister Creed and Factories at Forum,"Following a meeting of the Beef Forum with Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed and the meat factories in Dublin this week, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the clear message was that beef markets are in a strong position and there is no basis for any pressure on cattle prices.
Woods said both Bord Bia and the factories confirmed the positive position on the beef markets and Minister Creed said live exports were performing very well, up 43% to date this year, which he described as very positive.
Angus Woods said Bord Bia confirmed that market demand for beef is strong, export market prices, particularly in our main market in the UK, are very strong and due to increased live exports and lower carcase weights, cattle numbers will be a lot less than originally forecast.
Angus Woods welcomed the progress on market access to Japan and the US but said this must be turned into real cattle price delivery to beef farmers. “We need to see more progress on market access, especially to China and Asia. We also need a lot more work on live export markets like Egypt so as to increase price competition.”
The IFA Livestock leader welcomed the strong stance being taken by Minister Creed regarding opposition to an EU/Mercosur trade deal. He said Minister Michael Creed made it absolutely clear to the Forum meeting that it is firmly the Government position that beef must be excluded from any Mercosur deal and he will be vigorously pursuing this at the EU Farm Council next week in Brussels.
On Brexit, Angus Woods told Minister Creed and the Department of Agriculture that farming and the agriculture sector must be kept firmly top of the Government and EU agenda. He said the beef sector is particularly exposed and must be protected. In addition, he said beef farmers rely very heavily on direct payments for their income and Minister Creed must be demanding an increase in the CAP budget in Brussels. “Direct payments must be protected and increased for suckler cows, in line with the proposals from IFA,” Angus Woods said.
Angus Woods said the IFA again raised with Minister Creed the serious concerns of farmers over the lack of controls and oversight on carcase trim and classification at the meat plants. He said IFA has consistently demanded that the Minister for Agriculture direct AOs in the meat plants to monitor trim and classification on a constant daily basis in all meat plants. “Minister Creed accepted how important the trim and classification issues are for farmers and the Department indicated that they are progressing the matter of Agricultural Inspectors being on the line for constant monitoring so as farmers are protected.” Angus Woods reminded the Minister that the IFA had written to him directly raising very serious concerns on this issue."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/strong-action-needed-to-tackle-competition-issues-in-the-beef-sector-ifa-tells-ccpc/,2017-07-13,"Strong Action Needed to Tackle Competition Issues in the Beef Sector, IFA Tells Ccpc","IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods led an IFA delegation with senior officials in the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) in Dublin this week.
Angus Woods told the CCPC Director of Mergers that farmers do not believe that there is adequate price competition in the beef sector.
He made it very clear to the CCPC that it is their responsibility to guarantee robust competition in the beef processing sector. “Farmers have seen no evidence from the CCPC that they are prepared to take any action to tackle the competition issue at processing level,” he said.
Angus Woods said the recent developments on mergers in the beef and sheep sectors raise serious concerns for farmers about price competition and increasing the power of processors.
The Authority is currently considering the merger between Dawn and Dunbia and IFA was meeting the Authority on this matter and the broader issues around the lack of competition and transparency in the beef sector.
Angus Woods said, “It is the responsibility of the CCPC to carry out a proper and full investigation into this merger and to publish the outcome so that farmers can see what investigative work was carried out and what rationale they use to arrive at their decisions”.
He told the CCPC that studies conducted by independent competition consultants point to a strong body of evidence that competition in the primary procurement markets for cattle is weak and that he said that additional mergers were likely to weaken competition even further.
Angus Woods said the lack of transparency around market returns, wholesale prices and profits across the meat chain from processing right through to retail level is unacceptable and impedes competition.
He called for action at national and EU level to address this issue and pointed to the clear and robust system of transparency in place in the USA. Under legislation introduced in the USA, meat processors are required to report wholesale prices and stocks twice each day across all beef cuts sold."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-price-strong-this-week/,2017-07-17,Cattle Price Strong This Week,"National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the cattle trade is stronger this week with the base price for steers at €4.05/4.10 and €4.15/4.20/kg base being paid for heifers.
He said the lower quoted base price of €4.00 and €4.10 are gone at this stage, “Factories are very anxious for cattle over the weekend and struggling to get numbers. It is reported that numbers are very tight in some factories this Monday morning.”
Angus Woods said UK prices continue to rise with the AHBD advising that prices have climbed for the 15th consecutive week, to its highest level since January 2014. He said the R3 steer price is equivalent to €4.53/kg.
The IFA Livestock leader said the clear message from the Beef Forum was that beef markets are in a strong position and there is no basis for any pressure on cattle prices. “ Both Bord Bia and the factories confirmed the positive position on the beef markets and Minister Creed said live exports were performing very well, up 43% to date this year, which he described as very positive.”
Angus Woods said Bord Bia confirmed that market demand for beef is strong, export market prices, particularly in our main market in the UK, are very strong and due to increased live exports and lower carcass weights, cattle numbers will be a lot less than originally forecast."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/tighter-cattle-supplies-than-forecast-for-second-half-of-2017/,2017-07-20,Tighter Cattle Supplies Than Forecast for Second Half of 2017,"Beef production and cattle numbers for the second half of 2017 will be much less that originally forecast, according to IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods who said this paints a much more positive picture on the beef trade for the remainder of 2017.
There are three key factors impacting to lower beef production and numbers for the second half of 2017. For the first six months of the year, the kill is already up 40,000 head. These cattle are now slaughtered. Carcass weights are down significantly, by 8.2kg on steers alone, and across all categories of stock lower weights will result in the equivalent of a 30,000 head reduction in numbers. Live exports are running 43,500 head higher than last year.
At the start of the year, Bord Bia forecasted an increase in finished cattle supplies of 100,000 head on 2016. This forecast was based on AIMS data and the combined impact of an increase in calf registrations and a reduction in live exports in 2015 and 2016. However, the changes due to the increased kill to date, lower carcase weights and the increase in live exports all mean production and numbers for the second half of 2017 will be much lower than originally forecast.
There has been a significant reduction in carcase weights for the first five months of this year, with steer weights down 8.2kgs and heifers back 4.3kgs (Table 1). Angus Woods said, “If these carcase weight reductions are maintained for the full year, it will amount to a reduction of almost 10,000t of beef or the equivalent of a fall of 30,000 head in cattle numbers.”
In addition, Angus Woods pointed out that the kill to-date (8/7/2017) is up 40,000 head and live exports are up 43,500 on last year. While a lot of the increase in live exports are calves, the continuing export of young bulls to Turkey and other markets will take from slaughterings at the back end of this year. It is estimated that live exports will reduce the kill by 30,000 head (Table 2). When this is combined with the lower carcase weights and the increased kill to-date, the impact will be that the original forecast of a 100,000 head increase in slaughterings will be completely wiped out.
Angus Woods said that at a recent meeting of the EU Commission that he attended in Brussels, it was reported that EU consumption is up 1.5% and production is down by 0.5%. Market demand is very strong and there is no beef in store. Beef prices in our main export market in the UK have risen each week for the last 15 weeks in a row and are currently at the equivalent of €4.53/kg. He said these price increases outweigh any change in the sterling exchange rate.
The IFA Livestock leader said the clear message from the recent Beef Forum meeting on the trade was that beef markets are in a strong position and there is no basis for any pressure on cattle prices, “Both Bord Bia and the factories confirmed the positive position on the beef markets and Minister Creed said live exports were performing very well, up 43% to date this year, which he described as very positive.”

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-demands-stronger-policy-delivery-on-beef-and-sheep/,2017-07-25,IFA Demands Stronger Policy Delivery on Beef and Sheep,"Stronger action at EU and Government level is required to address the ongoing income challenges in the beef and sheep sectors, IFA President Joe Healy said today at the Farmers Journal open day on the Tullamore suckler and sheep farm.
The IFA President said a policy framework must be developed with the aim of returning viable cattle and sheep prices and increased targeted direct payments, which are essential to maintain confidence in the sectors and our national breeding herds which provide the backbone to €2.5bn in output value.
Joe Healy said technical efficiency is very important inside the farm gate, as demonstrated by the Tullamore farm, but getting the national and EU policy right for a profitable sector at farm level is absolutely essential.
The IFA President said viable price returns to farmers are possible from the market provided there is a fair share out of the retail price across the chain. He said cattle prices in the range from €4.00 to €4.50/kg are essential to cover the cost of production on the most efficient farms, and leave a margin. On lamb prices, he said mid-season prices need to be in the order of €5.00 to €6.00//kg.
Joe Healy said market demand for beef is strong and export market prices, particularly in our main market in the UK, are very strong. Cattle numbers will be much tighter than originally forecast due to increased live exports and lower carcase weights. “Beef markets are in a strong position and there is no basis for any pressure on cattle prices. In addition, live exports are performing very well, up 45%, with 140,000 head exported to-date this year.”
On Brexit, Joe Healy said Minister Creed and the Department of Agriculture must keep farming and the agriculture sector firmly at the top of the Government and EU agenda. He said the beef sector is particularly exposed and must be protected.
In addition, he said beef and sheep farmers rely very heavily on direct payments for their income and Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed must demand an increase in the CAP budget in Brussels. “Direct payments must be protected and increased for suckler cows and sheep, in line with the proposals from IFA,”
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the EU Commission has confirmed to IFA that Ireland can add on payments for welfare to the existing Beef Data and Genomics Programme for suckler cows. He said this would help increase direct payment for suckler cows towards the IFA target of €200 per cow and could be financed from the National and EU underspend across some RDP schemes.
Angus Woods welcomed the progress on market access to Japan and the US but said this must be turned into real cattle price delivery to beef farmers, “We need to see more progress on market access, especially to China and Asia. We also need a lot more work on live export markets like Egypt, so as to increase price competition.”
Joe Healy also welcomed the strong stance being taken by Minister Michael Creed in opposition to an EU/Mercosur trade deal. He said Minister Michael Creed has made it absolutely clear that beef must be excluded from any Mercosur deal. He said the Mercosur trade issue is beginning to heat up in Brussels and now is the time to drive Ireland’s opposition at the highest levels in Brussels.
IFA National Sheep Chairman John Lynskey said the New Sheep Welfare Scheme, secured by IFA, was a positive boost to sheep farmers, worth €10 per ewe or €20m per year. He said IFA has proposed that the €5m underspend in the scheme be retained in the sheep sector and increased to bolt on an additional €5 per ewe environmental element to the scheme, for hill and lowland producers. Again, John Lynskey said the EU Commission has confirmed to IFA that this is possible under the RDP regulations."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/farmers-resisting-beef-price-pressure/,2017-07-31,Farmers Resisting Beef Price Pressure,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said farmers are strongly resisting unnecessary pressure from the factories this week on cattle prices.
He said the base price for steers is generally €4.00/kg with some deals at €4.05/kg and some factories trying to offer less. On heifers, he said the general base price is €4.10/kg but again some plants are attempting to quote less to frighten producers into selling.
Angus Woods said the latest market update from the UK is that cattle prices continue to rise with R3 steers at £3.78p/kg, which is the equivalent to €4.48/kg.
In addition, he said the official Department of Agriculture average reported prices paid by the factories for week ending July 23rd were €4.16/kg for R=3= steers and €4.27/kg for heifers.
Angus Woods said the mart trade remains firm with strong live export and farmer buying.
On numbers, he said the increase in the kill to-date, lower carcase weights and the increase in live exports, will leave cattle supplies tighter than anticipated for the second half of the year."

He said the factory price cuts are not justified based on market returns, pointing out that cattle prices in our main market in the UK continue to rise to the equivalent of €4.48/kg. In addition, he said there is no beef in stock. EU and international markets are stronger than last year and hide and offal returns are also higher. Last year, there was a serious overhang of beef from the cull in the EU dairy sector, which is not the case this year.
On supplies, Angus Woods said the increase in the kill to-date, lower carcase weights, and the increase in live exports, will leave cattle supplies tighter than anticipated for the second half of the year.
The IFA Livestock leader said farmers need to be well armed with the true market position and not be manipulated or bullied by self-serving propaganda.
He said the base price for steers is generally €4.00/kg with some deals at €4.05/kg and all factories quoting €3.95/kg. On heifers, he said the general base price is €4.10/kg but again plants are quoting less to frighten producers into selling.

He said last week’s kill was 32,784, up just 1,000 head on the previous week, despite the aggressive price cutting propaganda of the factories to drive out numbers.
Angus Woods said demand for beef in the main markets remains strong and it is clear the factories need the cattle. He said, “A few weeks ago cattle supplies were over 33,000 and prices were running at €4.10/€4.20 for steers and heifers, and market demand has not slackened since.”
The IFA livestock leader accused the factories of undermining the beef market with unnecessary cattle price cuts geared at eroding confidence at farmer level. He said the factory price cuts of 20c/kg over the last three weeks have squeezed out any profit for farmers in the low income beef sector, where average incomes for 2016 were reported at only €16,853 including direct payments.
He said the factory price cuts are not justified based on market returns, pointing out that cattle prices in our main market in the UK are equivalent to €4.39/kg. In addition, he said there is no beef in stock. EU and international markets are stronger than last year and hide and offal returns are also higher. Last year, there was a serious overhang of beef from the cull in the EU dairy sector, which is not the case this year.
On supplies, Angus Woods said the increase in the kill to date, lower carcase weights, and the increase in live exports, will leave cattle supplies tighter than anticipated for the second half of the year.
The IFA Livestock Leader said the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) cannot continue to ignore what is happening on cattle prices over recent weeks. He accused the factories of using reverse market economics by employing prices cuts to force cattle out. Nobody can explain how strong market demand for beef is resulting in lower cattle prices back to farmers, Angus Woods concluded."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-and-livestock-sector-the-heartbeat-of-rural-ireland/,2017-08-13,Beef and Livestock Sector the Heartbeat of Rural Ireland,"The beef and livestock sector is the very heartbeat of rural Ireland and must be defended and secured in the face of major challenges, IFA President Joe Healy said today at the AIB Tullamore Show.
Joe Healy said the sector accounts for €6.6 billon in overall output with an economic impact spread across every rural parish in the country.
However, the IFA President warned that there are major challenges facing the Irish beef sector ranging from Brexit, the Mercosur trade deal, CAP reform to falling cattle prices and unacceptably low incomes for farmers.
“It has never been more important that our new Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, along with Agriculture Minister Michael Creed show strong political leadership in defending the sector. Equally, every section of the industry from farmers to factories, and all others involved in the business, must play their part in a united and responsible way to secure a viable future for the sector,” Joe Healy said.
On Brexit, Joe Healy said the Government must keep farming and the agriculture sector firmly at the top of the agenda in Dublin and Brussels. He said the beef sector, with 260,000 tonnes of exports to the UK, is particularly exposed and must be fully protected.
The IFA President said the reality is livestock farmers rely very heavily on CAP direct payments for their income. He said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed must demand an increase in the CAP budget in Brussels. Direct payments must be fully protected and increased for suckler cows, in line with the proposals from the IFA.
There is a real test emerging in Brussels this October on beef in the EU-Mercosur trade negotiations, Joe Healy said.
He said an EU impact assessment has shown that Mercosur could have a very damaging impact on the Irish beef sector and there must be full support for Minister Creed’s position that beef is excluded from any Mercosur deal.
Beef price squeezing out any change of profit
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said weekly beef price cuts at the meat factories must stop as they are squeezing out any chance of profit for farmers grazing cattle this year. He said €80 per head had been knocked off cattle prices over the last four weeks and this is costing farmers €2m per week.
Angus Woods said the price cuts are eroding confidence at farm level, where average beef farm incomes were only €16,853 in 2016, including direct payments.
He said the factory price cuts are not justified based on market returns, pointing out that cattle prices in our main market in the UK are equivalent to €4.39/kg. In addition, he said there is no beef in stock. EU and international markets are stronger than last year and hide and offal returns are also higher. Last year, there was a serious overhang of beef from the cull in the EU dairy sector, which is not the case this year. Cattle numbers will be much tighter than originally forecast due to the higher kill earlier this year, increased live exports and lower carcase weights."

He said cattle prices have been cut by more than €100 per head in the last month, eroding any chance of profit for farmers selling cattle over the peak autumn months.
Joe Healy said Minister Creed and the Department of Agriculture have worked hard and made considerable progress on market access issues and he cannot allow the factories to undermine the value of this work with unjustified beef price cuts.
He said the Minister has to insist that there is competition in the trade and market returns are fairly passed back to farmers. In addition, he must ensure that market access delivers real price gains and stability to farmers.
The IFA President said market demand for beef remains strong. He said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK are the equivalent of €4.42/kg including VAT, as reported by the ADHB and price increases in the UK market, have outpaced the changes to the Sterling exchange rate over the last two months. He said EU cattle prices are showing signs of improving which would be expected at this time of year as the schools prepare to return. In addition, he said there is no overhang of stock as was the case from the EU dairy cow cull this time last year and the demand for manufacturing beef is very buoyant."

Joe Healy said IFA made it abundantly clear to the meat factory representatives that anger is rising among farmers over the speed and severity of the beef price cuts over the last month.
Joe Healy said IFA made it very clear to the factory representatives that the cattle price cuts must stop. He said the €100 per head cut in cattle prices had gone too far and it is essential that stability and confidence is restored at farm level.
The IFA President said the meat factories need to invest in their farmer suppliers at this time of uncertainty in the market with currency fluctuations.
Angus Woods told MII that cattle farmers are under savage income pressure from the price cuts. He said the negative message from the factories to farmers was overdone and it was time for stability to be restored."

The farmers’ information was organised by Fine Gael TD for Westmeath Peter Burke and took place on the beef and sheep farm of Paddy Donnelly at Balrath, Mullingar. Guest speakers were the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the IFA President Joe Healy.
Joe Healy said the severe impact of the Brexit sterling exchange rate crisis on the incomes of beef farmers and mushroom growers can no longer be brushed aside and he called on Minister Creed to mount an urgent and decisive Government action plan at national and EU level to deal with the crisis. He said in recent days the sterling problem was also being used to pull back lamb prices.
“Sterling has been falling since April, when the UK the general election was called, when it was at 85p:€1. The decline has accelerated in recent weeks, with sterling falling to 93p:€1 by the end of August.”
The IFA President said it is imperative that the Government now seeks EU support for farm level measures that will counteract the price drops, which are arising directly from the sterling depreciation, independent of other normal market forces.
Joe Healy said Minister Creed must pursue the following funding in Brussels as part of a Government action plan.
Demand that the CAP Crisis Reserve fund be used to provide direct support to farmers. The crisis reserve is intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting agricultural production or distribution.
Secure direct support at EU level for affected producers through CAP Market Support measures, with support sought under Article 221 of the Single CMO, which provides the Commission with the authority to deal with Specific Problems
Request an increase in EU State Aid De Minimis limits to target support at the mushroom sector.
In addition, at national level in Budget 2018, the Government must provide funding support to the primary agriculture sector through:
Increased funding support to increase payments for the Areas of Natural Constraint to €230m.
Additional support for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme of €25m for a bolt on welfare element worth €50 per suckler cow.
Funding of an additional €5m for the Sheep Welfare Scheme to provide a €5 per ewe top up for hill and lowland producers who undertake additional environmental measures.
Delivery of low-cost loans which will be available to all sectors of farming, including the mushroom sector
Increased funding for the TAMS farm investment programme and the Scheme of investment aid for commercial horticulture"

He said, “Farmers are being thrown overboard on cattle prices and Agriculture Minister Michael Creed is allowing a combination of the Brexit exchange rate crisis and opportunism by the factories to push all the price cuts down on top of farmers”.
Joe Healy said IFA will meet Minister Creed next week. Farmers will be expecting urgent action from him to halt the factory price slide and restore some confidence to the trade as we head into the peak autumn kill.
As part of IFA’s campaign, County Chairmen, Livestock Representatives along with feeders will be meeting with factory management at local level around the country to highlight the anger at the price cuts and demand that confidence be restored in the trade.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said based on the sterling depreciation, Irish beef farmers are losing close to €2m per week. Since April, the UK beef market is up 7%. As our most important market, this should be good news. The problem is that sterling is down 8% in the same time period. When the UK election was called, Sterling was at 85p:€1. It had been at, or close to that level, in previous months. Today it’s 92p:€1. The impact on the price of beef is about 15c/kg.
IFA will be demanding delivery from Minister Creed on the following issues to alleviate the income crisis at livestock farm level. The Minister must:
Call in the factories and insist that they stop the price cuts and restore confidence to the livestock trade;
Demand that the CAP Crisis Reserve fund and Market Support measures be used to provide direct support to farmers in response to the Brexit exchange rate crisis;
In Budget 2018, secure additional support for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme of €25m for a bolt on welfare element worth €50 per suckler cow;
Secure increased funding support to increase payments for the Areas of Natural Constraint to €230m;
Deliver low-cost loans, available to all sectors of farming, including the mushroom sector.
Ensure that there is competition in the beef trade through a combination of a strong live export trade and demand that the CCPC insist on a properly functioning market;
Prioritise the live export trade and secure further live export contracts for the autumn to Turkey and other markets;
Demand that beef be excluded from any EU market access offer on Mercosur; and
Honour the commitment made to appoint AOs (Agricultural Officers) to monitor carcase trim, classification and weights at meat plants on a daily basis."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/factories-paying-more-to-get-cattle-with-strong-beef-demand/,2017-09-14,Factories Paying More to Get Cattle with Strong Beef Demand,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said farmers should not take lower quoted prices for cattle as factories are paying more to get stock.
He said market demand is very strong; factories are looking for more cattle and finding it hard to get the numbers in places. He said the general base price is for steers is €3.80/kg with the base price for heifers at €3.90/kg.
Angus Woods pointed out that some factories have paid a steer base of up to €3.88 in the last week and a heifer base price of €3.95, reflecting the extra bite in the trade and tighter availability of stock, especially in the south, east and north-east of the country.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said the official Department of Agriculture average price for R=3= grade steers for week ending September 3rd was €3.92/kg and €4.03/kg for heifers. He said R and U grade bulls were sold at €3.89 and €4.03/kg.
Angus Woods said the sterling exchange rate has moved back to 90p/€ in recent days and at a UK R3 steer price of £3.83, this is equivalent to €4.48/kg including VAT. He said the latest figures from UK retail sales show that prices are up 1.3% and volumes up 3.1%.
In addition, he said EU beef prices have increased in recent weeks and are 20c to 30c/kg over last year’s levels in the main EU markets. International beef sales are also very strong and manufacturing beef prices are exceptionally strong, up almost €1/kg.
On the live export side, Angus Woods said it is expected that there will be a new contact to Turkey for 15,000 – 25,000 weanlings. He said this is vitally important for the suckler sector."

He said that when sterling went the other way every factory and agent used it as the excuse to pull prices and it is of critical importance that the market is now seen to be working.
Angus Woods said each 1p move is worth 3c/kg, taking account of the volumes that go into the very strong UK market.
Angus Woods said the base price for steers is €3.80/kg and €3.90/kg for heifers. He said some factories are quoting less but having to pay above quotes to get stock. In addition, he said base prices of €3.85 and €3.95 have been offered to get stock.
The IFA livestock leader said demand in the market is strong with a very strong demand for manufacturing beef. He said the kill is in the 35/36,000 head per week range and it is clear factories are very anxious for stock. Last week’s kill was 36,112.
Angus Woods said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK remains very strong. R3 grade steers in the UK are making £3.84/kg which is the equivalent of €4.60/kg including VAT."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/cattle-supplies-tighter-as-beef-demand-remains-very-strong/,2017-09-25,Cattle Supplies Tighter as Beef Demand Remains Very Strong,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the beef trade is steady this week with the base price for steers at €3.80/kg and heifers making €3.90/kg. He said finished supplies are definitely tightening and demand remains very strong with some reports of top prices of €3.85 and €3.95/kg.
In our main export market, the UK, the ADHB are reporting the steer price (R3) at £3.83p/kg, which is equivalent to €4.59/kg including VAT. Angus Woods said cattle prices in the UK are running at 20p/kg above the same levels as this time last year and market demand is very strong. He said the change in the sterling exchange rate and the strong prices in the UK provide ample room for factories to increase prices back to famers here.
Angus Woods said to date this year the kill is up over 64,000 head and an additional 50,456 head have been exported live. He said this will leave numbers tighter in the weeks and months ahead.
The latest official Department of Agriculture average prices for week ending 17/9/2017 show that steers (R=3=) made an average of €3.91/kg or 8c/kg above last year’s levels. Heifers made €4.00/kg and U/R/O grade young bulls made €4.03/3.85/3.71/kg. In addition, cows made U/R/O/P+ made €3.60/3.50/3.30/3.25/kg. The cow price was 18c to 32c/kg above the same week last year reflecting the strong market and price return for manufacturing beef."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ccpc-must-deal-with-the-lack-of-competition-in-the-beef-sector/,2017-09-29,Ccpc Must Deal with the Lack of Competition in the Beef Sector,"Speaking following the decision today by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to clear the acquisition of Dunbia by Dawn Meats, IFA President Joe Healy said the CCPC must take their head out of the sand and address the serious lack of competition in the Irish beef sector.
Joe Healy said it is the responsibility of the CCPC to ensure that there is competition in the beef sector but they are failing in their duty in this regard. He said IFA met the CCPC and put a detailed independent report to them addressing the lack of competition in the beef sector. He said farmers expect the CCPC to utilise the powers they have under the law to undertake a full and proper investigation of all of the issues around the lack of competition in the beef sector.
He said it is farcical for the CCPC to state that they were not provided with any information to suggest the existence of any form of ‘coordination of prices’ for the purchase of cattle. He said the CCPC should use their statutory powers to unearth this information. They cannot expect that it will be handed to them by the industry. He said farmers have no confidence in either the desire or the ability of the CCPC to tackle this problem.
Joe Healy said that if it were not for the live export trade the situation would be even worse. He said the only area where farmers see price competition is through a strong and vibrant live export trade.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the evidence of the recent cattle price cuts and changes with sterling again clearly point to a lack of competition. He said “Factories told farmers in August and September that the price cuts were as a result of the weakness of sterling going out to 93p/€. However, the exchange rate is now back to 88p/€, yet cattle prices are not increasing. Nobody can explain this and worse still the CCPC appears to just ignore it.”"

He said the Christmas trade is kicking in at this stage and factories need the stock. He said farmers are not parting with cattle at the lower quoted prices on offer from some factories and are insisting and getting a base price of €3.75/kg for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers.
Joe Healy said across our main Continental EU beef markets, cattle prices are up 30 cent/kg since this time last year, with very strong demand for manufacturing beef evident in stronger cull cow prices. In Britain, our largest export market, R3 steer prices are £3.76/kg, equivalent to €4.45/kg including VAT.
The IFA President said large volumes of cattle have already been killed and exported live this year. The kill is already up 72,000 head, 38,000 additional young bulls have been shipped to Turkey in the last 12 months and carcase weights are an average of 6kgs per head lower, accounting for the equivalent of another 30,000 head of cattle. He said all of these disposals, which amount to 140,000 head, have eaten well into any extra numbers and will leave supplies much tighter than originally anticipated.
Angus Woods said the factories were offering €3.80/kg for R grade bulls and €3.90/3.95 for U grades. He said cow prices are a strong trade with €3.60 for U grades, €3.50 for R grades, €3.30 for O grades and €3.20 for P grades.
The IFA livestock leader said the most recent Department of Agriculture official paid prices at the factories for week ending October 15th show that the average R=3= steer price was €3.85/kg, heifers were an average of €3.96kg, young bulls U/R/Os were at €4.01/3.83/3.64/kg and cows were making U/R/O/P+ €3.63/3.50/3.33/3.22/kg."

https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/ifa-demands-higher-beef-prices/,2017-11-06,IFA Demands Higher Beef Prices,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the cattle trade is stronger this week with factories very anxious for cattle.
He said the grass cattle are more or less gone and factories will have to pay a lot more to get cattle out of sheds. Some plants have paid a base of €3.80/kg for steers and €3.90/kg for heifers but were attempting to keep the quotes 5c/kg less. He said the improvement in the weather have also taken the pressure off farmers having to house store and weanling cattle.
With the Christmas market kicking in and prices much stronger in our main export market in the UK and EU, Angus Woods said farmers should dig in hard and demand a strong lift in prices at this stage. “With cattle prices in our main export market in the UK at the equivalent of €4.40/kg and prices in the main EU markets up 25c to 35c on this time last year, it is clear the market can pay a price increase. In addition, market demand for beef is strong especially for manufacturing beef, which is reflected in higher cow prices by 30c/kg.”
Angus Woods said young bulls were making €3.80/3.90 for R/U grades and some plants had offered €3.90/4.00/kg to shift numbers. Cows are moving at €3.30/3.35 for O’s and €3.50 for R grades.
On supplies he said the factory kill is already up 75,000 head. With this increase in the kill, lower carcase weights by an average of 6kgs, and increased weanling live exports of 40,000 to Turkey, future supply numbers may be much tighter than originally anticipated."

Angus Woods said, based on the higher UK and EU market returns, a substantial beef price increase from the factories was justified. He said UK cattle prices are the equivalent of €4.40/kg and prices in our main EU market are up 30c/kg compared to this time last year.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said winter finishers need an immediate price increase up to €4.00/kg and cattle prices need to continue to rise into Christmas.
Angus Woods said Teagasc figures show that winter finishers need a beef price in the range of €4.30 to 4.50/kg.
Angus Woods added that factories are very anxious for stock and are finding it extremely difficult to get numbers at the current low quoted prices. He said the kill to date this year is up 75,000 head, carcase weights are down an average of 6kg, accounting for another 35,000 cattle and an additional 40,000 weanlings have been shipped to Turkey in the last year. He said all of this points to finished cattle numbers being a lot tighter than previously anticipated."

He said factories are paying up to €3.90 base on steers and €4.00/kg base on heifers is much more common.
Angus Woods said farmers with suitable stock should dig in hard and demand full value. He said, based on the strong UK market return and the increase in EU prices of 30c/kg from last year, further price increases are well justified. “There is more in the price based on the market return and farmers need to dig it out,” he said.
The IFA National Livestock leader said there is very strong market demand with last week’s kill hitting 39,265 head. He said to-date this year the kill is up over 80,000 head and over 30,000 bulls and heifers have been shipped to Turkey. In addition carcase weights are down an average of 6kgs equivalent to another 35,000 cattle. All of this means numbers have been processed and are gone."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-rising-with-very-strong-market-demand/,2017-11-27,Beef Prices Continuing to Rise with Very Strong Market Demand,"IFA President Joe Healy said beef prices are continuing to rise with factories actively looking for finished cattle this week. He said last week’s kill was 39,800 and to date this year an additional 81,000 head of cattle have been processed.
Joe Healy said factories are prepared to pay well above quoted prices to get numbers. He said factories are offering a minimum base price of €3.90/kg on steers and €4.00/kg on heifers, with top prices of €4.05/kg paid.
Joe Healy said there is very strong market demand for fit cattle and finishers should maximise the opportunity to drive on prices. He said farmers are moving with the changing situation and are looking for a base of €4.00 on steers and €4.10 on heifers.
The IFA President said beef market prices are rising with UK prices up 2p/kg in the last week to the equivalent of €4.45/kg. He said cattle prices in the main EU markets of Italy, France and Germany are also up 40c/kg on this time last year. He said these are very substantial price increases in the big EU markets and show that there is major opportunity for Irish prices to rise further.
Joe Healy added that factories are very anxious for stock and are finding it extremely difficult to get numbers at the current low quoted prices. He said the kill to date this year is up 81,000 head, carcase weights are down an average of 6kg, accounting for another 35,000 cattle and an additional 40,000 weanlings have been shipped to Turkey in the last year. He said all of this points to finished cattle numbers being a lot tighter than previously anticipated.
Grading
Joe Healy said there are an increasing and worrying number of farmers complaining about grading at the meat plants. He said farmers should carefully check their grades and if they are not satisfied contact the plant or the IFA to have the grades checked.
He said IFA has demanded that Department Agriculture Officers are given the responsibility to constantly monitor both the carcase trim and classification on the line in meat plants. He said this is a commitment that must be honoured."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-remain-firm-with-very-strong-demand-and-supply/,2017-12-11,Cattle Prices Remain Firm with Very Strong Demand and Supply,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the Christmas beef trade is in peak demand this week and factories are very anxious for cattle. He said the difficult weather has disrupted some cattle deliveries today (Monday) and left some outlets short.
Angus Woods said prices remain firm with the base price for steers ranging from €3.90/kg to a top of €4.00/kg all in. He said heifers are in very strong demand with the base price at €4.05 to €4.10/kg.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman said market demand remains very strong and this is reflected in high cattle prices in the UK and across the main European markets. He said UK cattle prices at £3.78/kg are equivalent to €4.53./kg incl vat. at an exchange rate of 88p/€. Cattle prices in our main European export markets are up 30c to 40c/kg on last year’s levels. In France young bulls are making €4.20/kg incl 5.4% flat rate vat. In Germany young bulls are at €4.35 and in Italy young bulls have moved up to €4.46/kg.
Angus Woods said the increases in cattle prices are reflected in the higher official reported prices from the Department of Agriculture for week ended Dec 3rd which show that the average R=3= steer price was at €3.95/kg, heifers at €4.08. O/R/U grade bulls at €3.80/3.95/4.05 and Cows U/R/O/P+ at €3.66/3.56/3.33/3.20./kg.
He said the weekly factory kill had moved up to 40,473 and the total kill is up 93,000 head.
Angus Woods said IFA has led the charge for price increases for winter finishers in the lead into Christmas and he highlighted that Teagasc figures which show that winter finishers need a beef price in the range of €4.30 to €4.50/kg.
On Live exports Angus Woods said numbers are up 45,000 on last year at 179,000 head. Exports to Turkey are running at 27,227. 2 boats are expected to load and sail pre-Christmas. IFA working with DAFM on ferry access for next Jan/Mar, when Stena propose to dry-dock their existing vessel from mid Feb to mid-March, a crucial 4 week period during the calf export season."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/new-year-beef-market-commences-strong/,2018-01-04,New Year Beef Market Commences Strong,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said there was a very strong sell out of beef over the holiday period and the market has recommenced strongly again.
He said factories are finding it difficult enough to get cattle and paying €4.05/kg base for steers and €4.15/kg base for heifers this week.
He said, with the 100,000 head increase in the kill for 2017 and the big weekly kills in the autumn, supplies are expected to be tighter in 2018.
Angus Woods said cattle finishers need to dig in hard and drive on prices over the coming weeks as winter finishing at this time of year is a very costly enterprise.
The IFA livestock leader said based on price returns from our largest export market in the UK and our main markets across Continental Europe, there is significant potential for cattle prices to rise.
Angus Woods said cattle prices in the UK are the equivalent of €4.40/4.45/kg for R3 steers including VAT. Across the main EU Continental markets R3 young bulls are making from €4.20 to €4.40/kg including VAT."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/winter-finishers-need-cattle-price-increases-not-cuts-ifa/,2018-01-24,Winter Finishers Need Cattle Price Increases Not Cuts – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said moves by the factories on cattle price are sending the wrong signals to winter finishers and damaging confidence at farm level.
He said that while there was the usual seasonal change in demand in the new year, cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have remained very strong, at the equivalent of €4.42/kg for R3 steers. Across the main EU markets, cattle prices are trading 20c to 30c/kg above 2017 levels.
Angus Woods said winter finisher need a strong price increase at this time of year, “Farmers feeding cattle in sheds since last autumn have run up considerable costs and the factories need to send a positive signal on price.”
Take a look at the prices paid by factories nationwide this week
He said there was a full sell-out of beef over the Christmas period, with exceptionally strong demand and there is no beef in store. In addition he said the manufacturing market and burger sales were particularly strong.
Angus Woods said the base price for steers is varying from a low quote of €3.95/kg to €4.00/kg and heifers are varying from a low of €4.05/kg with €4.10 and €4.15/kg paid in places.
The IFA livestock leader said the official paid prices recorded by the Department of Agriculture are much higher, reflecting the higher prices above quotes that factories actually pay and also reflecting the in-spec bonus payments. He said for the week ending January 21st, the official R=3= average steer price paid across the country was €4.07/kg. For heifers the average R=3= price paid was €4.22/kg.
For young bulls the average prices paid by the factories were U= €4.17, R= €4.02 and O= €3.89/kg. On cows U grades were paid an average of €3.76/kg, R grades €3.64/kg, O grades €3.43 and P+ grades €3.33/kg."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-stabilise/,2018-02-05,Beef Prices Stabilise,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the cattle trade has stabilised with some positive indications of tighter supplies and hardening prices.
He said in general, the base price for steers is at €3.90/kg and €4.00 for heifers. He said some top prices of €3.95 and €4.05 have been paid.
Angus Woods said beef prices needed to rise off the current low loss making levels for winter finishers.
He said based on returns from the UK, which are the equivalent of €4.40/kg and also strong returns across Europe, there is significant market potential for factories to lift prices."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-need-to-rise-for-winter-finishers/,2018-03-01,Beef Prices Need to Rise for Winter Finishers,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said cattle prices need to rise a lot more in order to leave a positive return for winter finishers. At current low prices, finishers are in loss-making territory.
Angus Woods said this week factories are paying a base price of €3.95 for steers and €4.05 for heifers. He said some prices above these level have been negotiated with a base of €4.07 and €4.08 plus transport paid for heifers. He said supplies are being disrupted by the weather difficulties and some feeders close to plants that can guarantee supplies are being offered more.
The IFA Livestock leader said last week’s supply of adult cattle was just over 34,000 head and demand has also picked up well since January. He said cull cow prices were rising in the UK market reflecting the strong trade in manufacturing beef."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-trade-remains-steady/,2018-03-27,Beef Trade Remains Steady,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said the beef trade remains steady with factories paying €4.00 base for steers and €4.10/kg base for heifers. He said top base prices of €4.05/kg has been paid to secure steers and factories are anxious for numbers.
Angus Woods said the cow trade is also strong with P grades making €3.30/3.40/kg, O grades at €3.40/3.50/kg, R grades at €3.60/3.70/kg and U grades making €3.70/3.80/kg. He said factories specialising in cows are paying higher prices for quality cows.
The IFA livestock leader said young bulls are making €3.95/4.00/kg for R grades and U grades are making €4.10/kg and more in places.
Angus Woods said the weekly kill at the factories is quite strong at 35/36,000 head per week but market demand is also strong. He said to date this year we have processed similar numbers to last year with throughput of 368,985 to week ending March 17th.
Cattle prices across our main markets in the EU are better than last year with UK R3 steers reported at the equivalent of €4.32/kg including VAT. In France R3 young bulls are making €4.10/kg. In Italy and Spain R3 young bulls are making €4.13/k and the highest price is in Germany where young bulls are making €4.27/kg.
On the live export side, Angus Woods said calf exports are going well but he hoped numbers would pick up over the coming weeks. In total live exports are running ahead of last year’s levels at 44,268 to March 10th. International live exports to turkey and Libya are also positive with 7,600 exported so far this year."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-prices-stronger-ifa-2/,2018-04-19,Beef Prices Stronger This Week,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the beef trade is stronger this week with cattle prices continuing to rise and some factories paying top base prices of €4.10/kg for steers and €4.20/kg for heifers.
Angus Woods said cattle prices are continuing to rise, up 5c/kg in the last week. He said some factories are trying to contract price cattle for the very scarce weeks of May, June and July. He said feeders would need to do their figures carefully as feed prices have risen rapidly in recent weeks.
Angus Woods said with the very late spring and few cattle gone to grass, there will be little or no grass cattle available until July. This will leave long feed shed cattle very scarce and expensive as the weeks progress."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-move-up-by-5c-10c-kg-and-positive-prospects-on-eu-price-ifa/,2018-04-26,Cattle Prices Move Up by 5c-10c/kg and Positive Prospects on EU Price – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the cattle trade is stronger again this week with prices moving ahead by 5c to 10c/kg, depending on location and also on the category of livestock.
He said the base price for steers has now moved up to €4.05/4.10/kg and for heifers to €4.15/4.20/kg. He said the higher prices of €4.10 and €4.20 appear to be more prevalent in the northern, eastern and western parts of the country.
Angus Woods said cow prices have also increased strongly this week, with some grades up 10c/kg on last week. He said some quality R grade cows are making up to €3.85/kg, with O grades as high as €3.60/kg and P grades on €3.45/kg in places. Young Bull have also increased in price with €4.10/kg available for R grades and €4.20 plus paid for U grades.
At an EU Commission Beef Meeting he chaired in Brussels this week, Angus Woods said there was a more positive tone to prospects for the trade for 2018. The EU Commission is forecasting an increase in consumption of 0.4% and only a very small rise in production of 0.13%. He said the Commission is also forecasting that EU prime beef prices should rise by 1.3% and cow prices look set to increase by 3.83% in 2018. He said all the figures point to a strong recovery and growth in beef consumption across the EU markets with overall EU imports up and exports down for the first two months of 2018."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-rise-another-5c-10c-kg-this-week/,2018-05-04,Beef Prices Rise Another 5c-10c/kg This Week,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the beef trade continues to strengthen with prices rising by another 5c to 10c/kg this week.
He said the base price for steers has moved up again with farmers getting €4.10/kg and heifers making a base of €4.20/kg. He said some factories have had to pay €4.15/kg for steers and €4.25/kg for heifers to get numbers.
Angus Woods said demand is very strong and tighter supplies have left factories chasing feeders for numbers. He said finishers need to bargain hard and make sure they are getting full value as all the market indications both here and in our main market in the UK point to higher prices in the coming weeks. He said with the very late spring there will be no volume of grass cattle until well into July."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-rising-2/,2018-05-10,Cattle Prices Rising,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices continue to rise this week with the base price for steers moving up to as high as €4.20/kg and tops of €4.30/kg for heifers.
He said the general run of prices is €4.15/4.25/kg but as factories are very anxious to get tighter supplies more and more feeders are doing deals at the higher base price levels.
Angus Woods said the strong market demand is also reflected in higher cow prices with P and O grade cows making €3.50/kg and R grades up to 3.80/kg. Top U grade cows are on €3.90/kg. In addition he said R and U grade bulls are making €4.20/kg with better prices for all U grades.
The IFA livestock leader said with the kill dropping back to 31,226, prices are continuing to rise. In addition he said cattle prices in the UK are maintaining their upward movement with further increase in the last week. The R3 steer price in the UK for week ended May 5th was £3.74/kg equivalent to €4.47/kg. Angus Woods said demand for beef remains very strong across the UK and EU markets.
Live Exports
Angus Woods said it is very positive that another boat load of heavier bulls is leaving Ireland this week for Turkey. He said this solid trade to Turkey is encouraging. In addition, he said some exporters are starting to put cattle on quarantine to be ready for private contract purchases.
To date this year, live exports are up 18% to over 120,000 head, of which over 100,000 head are calves. In addition, some 6,500 cattle have been exported to Turkey."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/irish-and-uk-cattle-prices-continuing-to-rise/,2018-05-21,Irish and UK Cattle Prices Continuing to Rise,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices continue to rise with the base price of €4.20/kg for steers more common, and €4.30/kg for heifers.
He said this is reflected when the official Department of Agriculture average paid prices for week ending May 13th which shows that the average R=3= paid price for steers was €4.28/kg including all bonuses and €4.34/kg for heifers.
Angus Woods said grass cattle are a long way off and farmers with cattle on feed should talk directly to their agent or factory procurement manager and work out both the delivery terms and the price.
He said supplies are going to be very tight over the coming weeks and farmers should insist on full value for their stock.
The IFA Livestock leader said the beef price in our main export market to the UK continues to rise with the ADHB reporting that the UK price is currently 12p higher compared to year earlier levels.
The gap between 2018 prices and the five-year average has been widening since mid-March, and is still increasing, with prices now over 19p above the five-year average. Industry reports suggest demand could stay ahead of supplies supporting the price through the summer, according to the ADHB.
Angus Woods said the R3 steer price in the UK is £3.75/kg, which is equivalent to €4.49/kg. Steer prices continued to gain and are up over 2p week-on-week. Steer carcases meeting the R4L specification rose 2p on-the-week to reach 379.9p/kg, which is the equivalent of €4.55/kg. incl vat."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/more-positive-market-forecast-on-beef/,2018-06-14,More Positive Market Forecast on Beef,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle supplies at the factories remain very scarce and both agents and procurement managers are scaremongering on price to try to frighten farmers out with stock. He said, “The reality for any farmer who has been in a factory lairage over the last two weeks is that numbers are extremely tight and factories are crying out for stock.”
Angus Woods said the market demand is very buoyant and the UK market very strong, with cattle prices in Britain equivalent to €4.51/kg including VAT. In addition, he said the World Cup will add to demand in the UK and across the EU over the next month.
The IFA livestock leader said cattle supplies will remain tight for the next number of weeks and the forecast for the second half of 2018 is very similar to last year. He said the latest figures from the Department of Agriculture AIMS data show that as of April 1st male cattle numbers in the 12 to 24 month age category are down 25,000 head compared to last year, and up 23,000 head in the 24 to 36 month age group.
He said with the kill up over 20,000 head to date this year, a large number of this older group could already be sold. On the female beef cattle side, he said there was an additional 7,000 in the 24 to 36 month age group and an extra 21,000 in the 12 to 24 month age category.
In addition, Angus Woods said the potential for the live export trade to move more young bulls and heifers this year looks positive
Angus Woods said the recent EU Beef Forecast Group meeting in Brussels are predicting a more positive outlook on beef and have revised their figures to show a contraction in production for 2018 by -0.4% and have also forecasted an increase in consumption by +0.3%. He said this is a positive turnaround for the sector. The EU is forecasting male bovines will increase in price by +1.3% and cow prices will increase by +3.8%."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-supplies-not-meeting-demand-on-beef/,2018-06-21,Beef Supplies Not Meeting Demand on Beef,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said factories are struggling to buy cattle at the lower quoted prices this week and having to pay at least a base of €4.15 and €4.25 for steers and heifers to get adequate numbers.
He said supplies are not meeting demand and factories are hungry for cattle with farmers in no rush to move stock that are thriving well on grass.
He said the general run of prices this week is a base of €4.15 for steers and €4.25 for heifers. He said some top prices of €4.20 and €4.30/kg were paid earlier in the week.
The factories are using the slight increase in the cow kill to try to put pressure on prices and Angus Woods said farmers need to be aware that there is a difference of 10-15c/kg in cow prices depending on the factory and the numbers on offer.
R grade cows are making €3.60 to €3.70/kg and P and O grade cows are making from €3.35 to €3.55/kg with flat deals for mixed loads.
Angus Woods said both in Ireland and the UK supplies are not meeting demand and the World Cup has given a strong boost to beef consumption in the UK and across the EU.
In our main export market, cattle prices continue to rise with R3 grade steers making £3.77/kg equivalent to €4.52/kg including VAT."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-creed-must-challenge-factories-directly-on-price-cuts-ifa/,2018-06-25,Minister Creed Must Challenge Factories Directly on Price Cuts – IFA,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the meat factories are up to their usual seasonal undermining of the beef price in a very concerted and damaging way.
Angus Woods said at this early stage the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed should immediately call in the key factory players and challenge them directly over their actions.  “The Minister has invested heavily in the beef processing sector in terms of market access over the last two years and made considerable progress. He cannot allow the factories throw all of this work back in his face with constant weekly price cuts that are not justified by market changes.”
Angus Woods said factories are currently paying a base of €4.10/kg for steers and €4.20/kg for heifers, but are quoting less for later in the week. However, demand remains strong with plants anxious for cattle. He said with the good weather farmers are busy and thrive is very good.
In our main export market in the UK, Angus Woods reported that slaughterings continue to tighten and prices continue to rise. For the week ending June 16th, prices rose by another 1.3p/kg with the R3 steer price at £3.80/kg, equivalent to €4.55/kg incl vat. He said the AHDB reported that the continued upward price trend recorded over the past few weeks indicates current market conditions have been in the producer’s favour; the all-prime average has strengthened by 16p/kg in the past four months.
The IFA livestock leader said cattle supplies will remain tight for the next number of weeks and the forecast for the second half of 2018 is very similar to last year. He said the latest figures from the Department of Agriculture AIMS data show that as of April 1st male cattle numbers in the 12 to 24- month age category are down 25,000 head compared to last year, and up 23,000 head in the 24 to 36-month age group.
He said with the kill up over 20,000 head to date this year, a large number of this older group could already be sold. On the female beef cattle side, he said there was an additional 7,000 in the 24 to 36-month age group and an extra 21,000 in the 12 to 24-month age category.

The IFA Livestock leader said the good news on live exports is very welcome and it was positive to see exporters active in the trade to Libya and also Turkey. He said the potential for the live export trade to move more young bulls and heifers this year looks positive."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/factories-exploiting-drought-conditions-to-cut-cattle-prices/,2018-07-02,Factories Exploiting Drought Conditions to Cut Cattle Prices,"IFA President Joe Healy said factories must stop cutting prices and undermining the beef market. He said the factories are taking advantage of the drought conditions and over the last four weeks, and have cut 20c/kg off the price, or up to €80 per head, which is the profit margin in most cases.
Joe Healy said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed needs to call the factories to halt and stop the unnecessary price rot. He said the Minister worked hard on market access for the factories and he cannot allow the factories throw all this back in his face with unjustified price cuts.
The IFA President said the beef market demand remains strong, especially around the manufacturing trade with the World Cup and the price cuts are not justified. Prices in our main export market in the UK remain strong and steady, with the R3 steer price at £3.79/kg, equivalent of €4.54/kg.
He said last week’s beef kill was 33,900 head, which was in line with the numbers this time last year of 33,615 head.
The IFA President said farmers facing grass shortages should examine all of the options, including meal feeding and avoid selling unfit or under finished stock.
Joe Healy also called on Minister Creed to demand an increase in the advance Basic Payment to 75% and an 85% advance on Rural Development measures. He said at a meeting of the Charter of Farmers Rights Monitoring Committee last week IFA called on the Minister Creed to seek these increases at EU level."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/stop-cutting-cattle-prices/,2018-07-12,Stop Cutting Cattle Prices,"Speaking at a National Livestock Committee meeting in Dublin this week, IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the factories have to stop cutting cattle prices and stabilise the market.
He said IFA has been in contact with Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed and the key factory players on the price issue. He said, “Our message is clear. Stop cutting prices and stop undermining confidence in the market place.”
Angus Woods said Minister Creed needs to urgently act and respond to the seriousness of the situation. “Minister Creed needs to call in the meat factories and tell them that they have to stabilise the beef price and stop undermining confidence in the markets. Stability on cattle prices is critical at this juncture and the Minister needs to ensure that the factories act in a responsible manner.”
Members of the National Livestock Committee and IFA County Chairmen, along with beef farmers will meet with factory management throughout the country to highlight the damage from the cattle price cuts and the need to stabilise the price and markets, and restore confidence.
The IFA livestock leader said the factories need to act in a responsible manner and must stop using the drought issues to undermine prices. He said the factories can stabilise the prime cattle prices as there is no additional volume of prime cattle and the market for prime cattle remains strong.
Angus Woods said the fall in cattle prices is seriously undermining incomes on beef farms and extremely damaging to the suckler herd. He said the most efficient beef farmers cannot produce beef at a price below the costs of production.
On numbers, he said the Department of Agriculture AIMS data on the key 12 to 24 month age category shows that there are only 9,000 more cattle in the system in April compared to last year and the kill to date this year is already up 22,000 head."

He repeated his call on Minister Creed to call in the factories and tell them bluntly to stop cutting the cattle price. “It’s time the Minister demonstrated he is on the farmers side.” He said the Minister has undertaken a lot of work on market access but it’s not giving a return back to farmers.
Joe Healy said the meat factories have taken advantage of their suppliers during the severe drought conditions. He said the factories have cuts cattle prices unnecessarily over recent weeks destabilising the beef market and eroding confidence in the sector. He said “beef farmers feel very let down by the factories”.
Joe Healy contrasted the negative approach from the meat factories with the much more supportive approach from the dairy co-ops towards their suppliers, where many co-ops are paying drought top-ups on the milk price as well as subsidising feed supplies and providing additional credit facilities.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the factories can stabilise beef prices at this critical juncture. IFA has been meeting with factory management at local level around the country highlighting the need for stability in the price. He said prime cattle prices must be stabilised and farmers cannot afford any further price cuts. He said incomes are being washed away with very substantial increase in costs and falling price returns.
He said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK remain very strong having eased only slightly for week ending July 14th with the R3 steer price at £3.77/kg, which is the equivalent to €4.46/kg incl. vat at an exchange rate of 89p/€.
Angus Woods said store market remains steady with quality forward stores meeting a strong trade at the marts."

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-accuse-factories-of-crippling-farmers-on-cattle-prices/,2018-09-13,IFA Accuse Factories of Crippling Farmers on Cattle Prices,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods accused the cattle factories of crippling cattle farmers financially with their obsession to cut beef prices and swell  their own pockets. He said the latest drive by the meat plants to cut prices below a base price of €3.80/kg will do serious financial damage at farm level.
Angus Woods pointed out that cattle prices in our main export market in the UK had increased by 4p/kg per week for the last 3 weeks and he contrasted this with prices cuts from the Irish factories. He said the factory pull on beef prices is inflicting massive damage on the weanling and store cattle trade in the marts across the country and undermining the suckler cow herd. He said the trade was already under severe pressure from the drought and fodder situation but the factory price cuts had ripped confidence out of the trade.
The IFA National Livestock leader said this year farmers have had to endure an extremely long and severe winter/spring period with massive meal bills. On top of this the drought involved farmers having to feed meals on grass at very significant additional expense and all of these bills are still there to be paid.
Angus Woods pointed out that cattle prices in our main export market are £3.76/kg(w/e Sept 1st), which is the equivalent of €4.40/kg. “Prices in the UK have increased every week from early August, rising from £3.63/kg to £3.76/kg, a price increase equivalent to 15c/kg.
At the same time Irish factories have cut the prices. This makes no market sense and farmers are at a total loss over the silence of Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and the Government on the issue. It’s like they don’t care about the €3bn livestock sector and the 100,000 farmers involved.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-are-furious-with-minister-and-factories-on-beef/,2018-10-02,Farmers Are Furious with Minister and Factories on Beef," Speaking at the IFA Beef and Suckler campaign meeting in Ballinasloe last night, IFA President Joe Healy said Minister Creed has one week left before the Budget to secure additional support for sucklers. He said, “Time is fast running out before the Budget for Minister Creed, and it’s vitally important that he delivers for sucklers next week”.
Joe Healy said IFA and livestock farmers from all over the country will be protesting outside the Beef Forum at the Department of Agriculture on Kildare St tomorrow Wed, Oct 3rd. at 10.00am with a strong message for both the Minister and the factories.  “Cattle farmers are furious with the way the Minister has allowed the factories to run amok and systematically cut cattle prices to loss making levels while at the same time prices are rising in our main export market in the UK.”
Joe Healy said the factories have used Minister Creed, flying around the world opening markets and driving exports, while at the same time cutting prices paid to farmers. He said what has happened this year is a real case of the tail wagging the dog and farmers are being asked to carry the costs in loss making beef prices.
The IFA President said the income pressure on cattle farms was a breaking point, following the severe weather conditions all year and the massive increase in costs. He said the way the factories have cut prices over recent weeks is ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’. The Teagasc national Farm survey data shows that for 2017, the average income on cattle rearing farms was only €12,529.
“Since mid-July the factories have hammered prices down from a base of €4.00/kg to €3.75 and now trying €3.70. They took advantage of farmers in the drought and used the weather and costs against them”.
He said “Factories have torn the hell out of prices and forced them down well below the cost of production. This also eroded confidence in the market place and wrecked the mart price for weanlings and stores. In late August/September, prices in our main export market in the UK started to rise, up 15p/kg in over 4 weeks. At the same time the factories turned up the heat on prices here and inflicted severe damage on farm incomes”.
“During this period, despite repeated requests, the Minister never lifted a finger against the factories. He called in the banks, he worked with the co-ops on the fodder issue but never said a word to the meat factories. He gave them free rein and let them run amok”.
Joe Healy said the Beef Forum protest is a warning shot for Minister Creed. “The Minister must deliver on sucklers in next week’s Budget. Minister Creed has to show he is on the side of farmers”."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-must-stop-standing-idly-by-as-beef-farming-goes-down-the-tubes/,2018-10-03,Minister Must Stop Standing Idly by as Beef Farming Goes Down the Tubes,"Addressing the IFA protest outside the Beef Forum today (Wed), IFA President Joe Healy said Minister Creed must stop telling everyone what he cannot do and act now to save beef farmers.
“Under the Minister’s Chairmanship, the Forum has become a mudguard for inaction. It isn’t even a talking shop. Recent meetings have become ‘death by powerpoint’ as farmers get presentation after presentation designed to run down the clock. There is no real engagement on the key issues,” he said.
Joe Healy said “The Minister hasn’t lifted a finger while the factories have robbed farmers by systematically cutting cattle prices.  At the same time, prices to farmers are rising in our main export market in the UK.”
He said that while Minister Creed was trying to wash his hands in relation to beef prices he has no excuse next Tuesday in the Budget. He must show beef farmers that he is on their side by providing additional support for the Suckler sector.
“Budget Day will be the acid test for Minister Creed. Beef Farmers will judge him on what he delivers for sucklers.”
“We’ve had enough of the Minister’s ‘can’t do it, won’t do it’ approach. It won’t wash with farmers. It’s time for action, it’s time for delivery. Next Tuesday is D-Day”.
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said farmers are furious with the Minister’s indifference to the income crisis on livestock farms. “We asked the Minister to tackle the factories when they took advantage of farmers on cattle prices during the drought. We presented a detailed report to him at the Tullamore Show on sucklers, which shows that a 10% reduction in suckler cow numbers will hit economic output in rural areas by €305m”.
Angus Woods said Minister Creed needs to be the Minister for Agriculture and to stand up for farmers, and not be the Minister for factories. “Minister Creed seems to be fixated on driving beef exports, with the gains going to the factories on the back of loss-making prices to farmers.”
He said the income pressure on cattle farms was at breaking point, following the severe weather conditions all year and the massive increase in costs. He said the way the factories have cut prices over recent weeks is ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’. The Teagasc National Farm survey data shows that for 2017, the average income on cattle rearing farms was only €12,529.
Angus Woods said “Factories have torn the hell out of prices and forced them down well below the cost of production. This also eroded confidence in the market place and wrecked the mart price for weanlings and stores. Prices in our main export market in the UK are rising, up 20p/kg in recent weeks”.

Joe Healy said increased demand for the Christmas trade is about to kick in and factories are trying to pin down numbers. He said farmers must demand and insist on a strong price increase as the market can pay it.
The IFA President called on the factories to immediately increase prices by another 10c/kg and pass back the improvements in the UK market prices and positive changes to sterling.
Joe Healy said the loss-making prices from the factories over recent weeks have inflicted serious damage on Irish livestock farmers and the beef sector.
The IFA President said UK cattle prices have increased consistently for the last eight weeks and are currently at £377/kg (R3 grade steer). This is equivalent to €4.51/kg incl. vat.

IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods cattle prices are rising and farmers must maximise any increases. He said farmers selling should not accept the quoted price and insist on much more.
Angus Woods accused the factories of taking advantage of their farmer suppliers over the summer/autumn.

He added that the Minister needs to do a lot more to assist the live export trade and get exports moving again to Turkey and other international markets.

The IFA Livestock leader was speaking following the submission of the Food Wise High Level Meats Group report to Minister Creed by the Chairman Michael Dowling.
Angus Woods welcomed the key issue on beef identified by all stakeholders as ‘introducing targeted support for sucklers’ in line with IFA policy. He said the Group accepted such measures, in addition to providing income support, should be clearly geared towards bringing environment and welfare quality benefits. The Group also considered the introduction of adding a welfare criterion under some form of enhanced BDGP scheme.
Angus Woods said the Food Wise group stressed that beef from the suckler herd is of ‘critical importance for the international marketability of Irish beef abroad and for the health and viability of the rural economy in large parts of the country’.  It stressed, however, that very low profitability will inevitably lead to a sharp drop in suckler output which will undermine the prospect of it making a viable contribution to the Foodwise ambitions for this sector.
The IFA Livestock leader said the Food Wise group also made some recommendations about improving the quality of dairy bred beef, genomic verification, grass fed beef and generational change.
Angus Woods said Brexit was identified as the main challenge across all the meat sectors of beef, sheep, pig meat and poultry. Brexit uncertainty should also necessitate the adoption of defensive positions in relation to EU trade deals with Mercusor, Australia and New Zealand, according to industry.  He said for sustainability at farm level, it is essential to secure beef prices above the cost of production and protect and maintain direct supports under CAP and the farm schemes."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-demand-strong-immediate-beef-price-increase-for-farmers/,2018-11-15,IFA Demand Strong & Immediate Beef Price Increase for Farmers,"IFA President Joe Healy said farmers are demanding a strong and immediate increase in beef prices.
He said beef farmers have been short-changed on the price this Autumn and its high time the factories restored some confidence to the beef sector and increased prices. These were the strong messages the IFA President delivered to Meat Industry Ireland (MII) leaders at a meeting with the IFA in Dublin this week.
Joe Healy told MII that livestock farmers need to see beef prices at the factories move up to at least €4.00/kg. He said cattle farmers have come through a horrendous year with incomes on the floor and its time the meat factories stopped profiteering on the back of farmers.
He said there is rising anger among farmers with the way the factories cut beef prices this autumn and continued to hold prices down at loss-making levels, despite strong returns from our main export market in the UK.
The IFA leader said with the increased demand for the Christmas trade and the strength of the UK market, factories can pay more.
Joe Healy said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK were at £3.73/kg for R3 grade steers, which is the equivalent of €4.42/kg.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-fight-for-beef-farmers-at-meeting-in-brussels/,2018-11-27,IFA Fight for Beef Farmers at Meeting in Brussels,"Chairing the EU Commission Civil Dialogue Group on Beef in Brussels, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the Committee worked through a number of critically important issue for Irish beef and livestock farmers at the meeting.
The main items addressed at the meeting included cattle prices; imports/exports; CAP 2020 proposals and direct payments; EU import standards and Brazil; trade negotiations including Mercosur and the USA; and Brexit.
  Angus Woods said the EU Commission presented a very detailed analysis of the EU beef market, highlighting the market difficulties from increased slaughter numbers related to the drought across the EU during the summer. Total EU production for 2018 is up 2%, with heifer output up 7.7% and cows up 3.9%.
  He said the prospects and forecast for 2019 are more positive with reduced production and a more stable market and price environment.
  IFA made a strong case on the need for cattle prices to increase as the income situation on farms is not sustainable with prices currently below the costs of production. The importance of a strong live export trade to Turkey was emphasised.
  The details of the CAP 2020 proposals were outlined to the meeting with the EU Commission DG Agriculture recognising how important direct payments are to livestock farm incomes. The IFA highlighted the damage to livestock farm incomes from the cuts to direct payments under the Ciolos reforms, saying ‘there can be no cuts to direct payments for livestock farmers under the Hogan reforms’. IFA made it very clear that the CAP Budget must be increased.
  At the EU Commission meeting, Angus Woods said the IFA raised the failure of Brazil to meet EU standards on the control of residues and contaminants in beef including the controls on veterinary products. He said the recent report from the vets in the European Food and Veterinary Office has stated the Brazilian ‘competent authorities are not in a position to reliably certify that the guarantees required by the relevant export certificates are complied with’. In practice, Angus Woods said this means that the EU Commission cannot rely on Brazilian certification of beef exports to the EU market.
  Angus Woods said on the Mercosur trade negotiations, the IFA raised the lack of coherence between the EU CAP policy and EU trade policy. He said the Commission strategy of increasing beef imports against the backdrop of Brexit and poor beef prices was fundamentally flawed and would seriously undermine the production base, especially the suckler cow herd.
  On Brexit, Angus Woods said the meeting concluded on the critical need for stability on beef and a positive outcome to the negotiations. He said the view of the meeting was for a longer transition period and a backstop.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/suckler-survival-needs-strong-government-support-ifa-2/,2018-12-18,Suckler Survival Needs Strong Government Support – IFA,"Addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture today (Tues), IFA President Joe Healy said of the many challenges to the Irish beef sector and our specialised suckler cow sector – Brexit, CAP reform, Mercosur trade negotiations, prices below the cost of production – the biggest single issue is low farm incomes.
The latest Teagasc data for 2018 shows average farm income of only €10,175 for cattle rearing, down 19%. This is not sustainable and we need a much stronger and more supportive Government policy for the suckler cow sector.
As part of the IFA campaign to secure additional targeted direct payments of €200 per suckler cow, we retained the services of the eminent agricultural economist, Professor Thia Hennessey, Head of the Cork University Business School in University College Cork.
Professor Hennessy and her team undertook a full assessment and overview of the suckler beef sector and produced a comprehensive report in August 2018 entitled The Economic and Societal Importance of the Irish Suckler Beef Sector.
Among its findings are:
 The beef sector accounts for over one-third of all agricultural output and over 20 percent or €2.6bn of our exports.
 The suckler cow herd of 900,000 is distributed throughout the country, but particularly dominating in the West.
 Suckler cows account for over 80% of cows in the West, with the figure in excess of 90% in some counties.
 77,738 specialist cattle farms spend over €1.5bn annually on agri-inputs, most of which is spent in the local rural economy.
 A €1m increase in the beef sector output would generate a further €2.11m in the wider economy and support an additional 16 jobs. The comparative figure for the agriculture sector more generally is €1.44m. Previous research has estimated that every €1 of direct payments to cattle farmers supports €4.28 of output in the wider economy.
 Suckler farmers contribute to wider societal sustainability, particularly as they are often located in marginal or economically disadvantaged areas, where their presence is vital to the social fabric and cultural capital.
 They produce public goods such as protection of the environment and biodiversity and the preservation of the landscape and unique features such as stonewalls and hedgerows all of which positively contribute to the image of rural Ireland and rural tourism.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said farmers need a much stronger and more supportive policy from Government for the suckler cow sector and we need to maintain our vitally important suckler cow herd.
In order to do this, we need a targeted direct payment of €200 per cow. We need a major price premium for suckler beef. We need a strong live export trade that will drive competition."

Joe Healy was speaking at a meeting of the IFA National Council in Dublin today.
“Our Taoiseach & Tanaiste have told us about all sorts of contingencies like customs posts and hiring extra vets, but we haven’t heard anything about what plan has been put in place to protect Irish farmers, who are the most exposed in Europe.”
The time has come for the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar & Agriculture Minister Michael Creed, along with the EU Commission, to come forward with a comprehensive programme of supports that will address the real issues around market supports and cattle prices.
“The problems with currency volatility and the Euro and sterling exchange rate has already hit cattle prices this year and we are down 20c/kg or over €70 per head on this time last year, when prices had already been hit. If the UK crashes out next March, we are facing a far more serious situation and the potential wipeout of beef production in this country,” he said.
Joe Healy said IFA has already discussed the need for strong EU market supports with the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Agriculture Minister Michael Creed, but it is now time for the Government to set out their plan and exactly what market and other supports will be put in place."

The IFA President said, “Minister Creed says that he intends to make Irish aid a key agenda item when the EU Farm Council meets in Luxembourg in early April, after the Brexit deadline. Bolting the door after the horse is gone is too late for farmers. We need a support plan in place long before then. The situation is now urgent.”
“The Minister has finally acknowledged that farmers are ‘losing their shirts’ at current prices. He needs to get on the pitch now and set out what exactly he will be seeking for Irish farmers,” he said.
“It is also imperative that whatever package is introduced will support farmers and that we don’t end up with aid going to factories rather than to farmers,” he said.
He said the prospect of ‘no deal’ before the end of March is alarming for all farmers, and especially livestock farmers who are increasingly concerned about prices and exports to our most important export market in the UK.
“If the UK crashes out in March, we are facing a far more serious situation and the potential wipe out of beef production in this country,” he said.
The time has come for the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar & Minister Michael Creed, along with the EU Commission, to come forward with a comprehensive programme of supports that will address the real issues around market supports and cattle prices.
“The problems with currency volatility and the Euro and sterling exchange rate has already hit cattle prices. We are down 25c/kg or over €90 per head on this time last year, when prices had already been hit.”"

Along with price supports, Joe Healy said the Minister needs to insist that for every 5c/kg change in the cattle price, the EU Commission makes provision for €20 per head compensation on every beef animal slaughtered.
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “Irish beef farmers cannot wait until April for the Minister to act on EU price support and compensation. We need Minister Creed to act immediately and get out to Brussels and make it clear to Commissioner Hogan and the Commission that Irish beef farmers cannot be the ones to carry the cost of Brexit losses.”
He said at current cattle price levels, winter finishers are already shipping major losses, which is not sustainable. He said prices are 25c/kg or €90 per head below this time last year.
Cattle prices at the factories are at a base of €3.75/kg for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers. Cow prices are ranging from €2.60 to €3.30/kg with R grades at €3.00+/kg."

He said the Brexit “wait and see” approach from Agriculture Minister Michael Creed is crushing hope and confidence in the sector.
“Livestock farmers feel the Minister is walking away from the sector”.
Angus Woods said Minister Creed needs to quickly get on side with farmers and make a cast iron case to Brussels for a package of measures which will fully compensate for the Brexit losses.
He said “For every 5c/kg change on the price, Minister Creed needs to secure €20 per head additional direct payment compensation”.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said it is clear cattle prices are being held down by Brexit and beef farmers are carrying the can for it. He said there is a very strong case for compensation to make good the negative Brexit impact for the losses already being racked up."

“We stressed to the Commissioner that Irish farmers, particularly in the beef sector, are already suffering huge losses as a consequence of the Brexit decision. Urgent action is needed from the Commission,” he said.
The IFA President said, “The Commissioner was clear that, while Brexit will impact all Member States to varying degrees, no Member State will be more affected than Ireland. He confirmed that the Commission is ready to support Ireland find solutions which deal with the specific challenges facing Irish businesses, not least Irish farmers and the Irish agri-food sector, which has a particular exposure to the UK. In that respect, the Commissioner was clear that the measures available under the CAP and used in other cases of market disturbance would be available”.
The tools used in previous disturbances such as BSE and the Russian import ban included intervention; Aids to Private Storage; and financial aid through additional direct payments.  The IFA has calculated that for each 5c/kg change in cattle prices, farmers would need €20 per head direct payment support.
“We also raised the issue of the CAP reform and in particular the need for a strong budget. The reduction in CAP payments has contributed to the drastic situation farmers find themselves in.  They cannot take any further cuts,” he said.
The delegation also raised the decision of the Turkish authorities to suspend live cattle imports until mid-February. “We asked Commissioner Hogan to raise the importance of the live export trade with the Turkish authorities during the ‘Global Forum for Food and Agriculture’ in Berlin this week”."

This has been compounded by the weakness of sterling and the major uncertainty around Brexit.
Joe Healy said compared to this time last year, cattle prices are down by 20/25 cents per kg or €100/head. Cattle finishers with young bulls are facing price cuts of 40c/kg+ and finding it almost impossible to sell their stock.
The IFA President said urgent action is required now by the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the government to ensure the following:
A comprehensive package of market supports and direct aid for farmers from the EU Commission
EU state aid limitations on members states must be set-aside
Strong support for the live export trade to double numbers in 2019 and ensure that no further restrictions are imposed on the trade
Increased funding for suckler cows
Continue to resist a damaging Mercosur trade deal
Insist on an increase in the CAP budget, and
Challenge the meat factories to immediately increase prices and prioritise the young bull kill.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said R3 grade young bulls in Ireland are reported at €3.71/kg for w/e Jan 19th.
“Compared to young bull prices across the main EU markets we are way behind with the Italian price at €4.55/kg inclusive vat, the German price at €4.05/kg, French bulls at €4.02/kg and the Spanish price at €3.98/kg,” said the IFA National Livestock Chairman.
“These figures indicate that Irish young bull producers are being short changed by up to 30c/kg compared to our European counterparts,” he said.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “We made it very clear to Minister Creed at the IFA AGM last week that he must reconsider his approach, abandon his ‘wait and see attitude’ and get back out to Brussels to secure an immediate aid package for Brexit beef losses”.

He said, “IFA estimate the imposition of WTO tariffs in a hard-Brexit will impose a direct cost on the beef sector of €800m per year”.
Joe Healy said while the Government and other sectors are talking about preparing for Brexit, beef farmers are already counting their losses. Cattle prices are down €100 per head on this time last year. He said Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of sterling has already hit hard on beef prices and farm incomes.
“The income situation on beef and livestock farms is at crisis point. The latest independent data from Teagasc shows farm incomes are down 16% in 2018 and incomes on cattle are between €10,175 and €15,412.”
IFA representatives from across the country assembled in Dublin today and lobbied TD and Senators from their constituencies on the beef crisis.
The IFA presented a detailed set of proposals including an EU Brexit Emergency Support Package to politicians, demanding that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed take urgent action with the EU Commission to address the Beef and Brexit issues.
The IFA proposals to Government and the EU Commission include;
An EU Brexit Emergency Support Package involving a comprehensive set of market supports and direct aid for farmers from the EU Commission
EU state aid limitations on members states must be set-aside
Challenge the meat factories to immediately increase prices and prioritise the young bull kill. Increase factory controls on trim, classification and weights.
Strong support for the live export trade to double numbers in 2019 and ensure that no further restrictions are imposed on the trade
Reward quality suckler stock with a significant price premium
Increased funding for suckler to €200 per cow
Insist on an increase in the CAP budget
Continue to resist a damaging Mercosur trade deal
Climate change recommendations which focus on the Teagasc roadmap with no carbon-based production quota.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said IFA has requested that for every 5c/kg change on the price, Minister Creed needs to secure €20 per head additional direct payment compensation.
Angus Woods said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and the Government must adopt an urgent approach to the crisis in the beef sector. He said the Minister needs to abandon his ‘wait and see attitude’ and get back out to Brussels to secure an immediate aid package for Brexit beef losses.
Angus Woods said IFA has met with EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan and senior EU Commission officials in Brussels in recent weeks and put forward a strong case for a Brexit aid package for Irish beef.
IFA also met with senior officials in the Department of Agriculture on EU supports and other measures needed for the beef and livestock sector."

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-call-on-minister-creed-to-take-urgent-action-in-brussels-on-beef-crisis-2/,2019-02-26,IFA Call on Minister Creed to Take Urgent Action in Brussels on Beef Crisis,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed needs to take urgent action in Brussels to drive home the magnitude of the Brexit situation for the Irish beef sector and insist that immediate measures are put in place to offset the losses already encountered by farmers. He said farmers with young bulls are being fleeced with prices down by 40c to 50c/kg or €200 per head.
“The message from the EU Commission in Brussels is that they are waiting for political instruction.” Angus Woods attended a meeting of the EU Commission Beef Market Observatory in Brussels last Friday, where the Commission said they have the tools and the mechanisms to support farmers, but need the political instruction.
“At the meeting, IFA raised the financial crisis facing cattle finishers in Ireland as a result of the Brexit uncertainty. We highlighted our dependence on the UK market and the damage already done by Brexit.”
The IFA Livestock leader said cattle finishers are being left in the dark, with the Minister promising but not delivering in terms of direct aid from Brussels. He said IFA has put specific proposals to the Department of Agriculture to assist the beef sector.
Angus Woods said the EU Commission should immediately look at restricting beef imports to improve the situation. The EU (including the UK) imports circa 330,000t of beef annually, of which about 245,000t or 75% comes from the Mercosur countries. The production standards in these countries fail to meet EU standards.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said he had discussion with his French counterparts, the FNB, who are very supportive of restricting South American imports. In the context of the Brexit uncertainty, Angus Woods said the EU should insist that beef is withdrawn from the Mercosur negotiations, which are set to resume in Buenos Aires on March 11th.
Angus Woods repeated the IFA call on the Minister and the factories to prioritise the young bull kill."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/cattle-farmers-facing-financial-ruin/,2019-03-19,Cattle Farmers Facing Financial Ruin,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said farmers selling cattle at the current unviable prices are shipping major financial losses and facing financial ruin.
  He called on the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to insist that the Brexit compensation package currently being negotiated with the EU to be applied retrospectively.
The IFA Livestock leader said it is very easy for Commissioner Hogan to tell farmers ‘not to panic’ and for Minister Creed to adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach, but the financial reality is Irish beef farmers are on their knees and urgently need a tangible response from Brussels, which addresses the Brexit losses. He said IFA has put detailed proposals to the Department of Agriculture on what’s needed for the beef and livestock sector.
  Angus Woods said the current base price for steers at €3.75/kg and €3.85/kg for heifers are down 25c/kg on this time last year or €100 per head. He said “There was little or no margin in it last year and at the low prices this year, finishers are facing financial ruin”.
  Angus Woods accused the factories and agents of overcooking the negativity around the cattle price, which he said has seriously damaged farmer confidence in the sector. “Cattle farmers have faced a barrage of negativity on the price since last autumn. It is incredible that the price has been stuck at a base of €3.75 for steers and €3.85 for heifers since last September.”
  The IFA Livestock leader pointed out that cattle prices in our main export market in the UK are £3.46 for the week ending March 9th, equivalent to €4.24/kg incl. vat at an exchange rate of 86p/€. He said this compares to the official Irish steer price of €3.84/kg for the same week, and highlights a price differential of 40c/kg or up to €150 per animal.
  Across the main EU markets R3 male cattle are making the following; Italy (Y Bulls) €4.31/kg, France (steers) €3.92/kg, Y Bulls €4.06/kg, Germany (Y Bulls) €3.93/kg, Spain (Y Bulls) 3.98/kg.
  Angus Woods said the very strong cattle price in our main export market in the UK and the stronger prices across the main EU markets for male cattle all indicate that the factories here could be paying more.
  On numbers, Angus Woods said the latest weekly kill of 34,200 excluding calves point to some level of tightening in supplies. This is the first time that the kill has come back to last year’s levels.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-accuse-the-factories-of-sabotage-on-cattle-prices/,2019-03-25,IFA Accuse the Factories of Sabotage on Cattle Prices,"IFA President Joe Healy said there was a concerted effort by the meat factories to drive down the price of cattle.  He said “This is naked opportunism by the factories on the back of beef farmers”.
“There has been a huge national focus on the threat posed by Brexit to beef and the national economy. A cut to cattle prices would be an irresponsible act of sabotage by the meat factories at a time when the focus needs to be on Brexit,” he said.
  Farmers selling cattle at a base price of €3.75/kg for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers are taking cuts of 20-25c/kg below last year’s price levels, or reductions of up to €100 per head. Farmers selling young bulls have been hit for €200 per head.
  IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said IFA has been in contact with all of the main meat factory bosses and MII on the cattle price issue.
  He said “With numbers set to tighten over the coming weeks, IFA and farmers are expecting cattle prices to rise”.
  Cattle prices in our main export market in the UK are £3.46/kg for w/e March 9th, equivalent to €4.24/kg at 86p/€ exchange rate. This is 40c/kg above the Irish price or €150 per animal. Across the main EU markets, R3 males are making from €3.90 to €4.30/kg.

We have already put this to Minister Creed and we are looking for the support of the Agriculture Committee,” he said.
Outlining the key points in the IFA Submission, Joe Healy said the FoodWise 2025 strategy has failed to address the income crisis for beef farmers and will have to be revisited.
“While the strategy has delivered substantial growth in the volume and value of beef output, it has not worked for farmers,” he said. Looking at data over the last seven years, beef exports have increased by €360m or 19%, but there has been no increase in cattle prices or farm incomes.
Joe Healy said the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the Government must address the income crisis at farm level, and implement policies which will deliver profitability to beef and livestock farmers.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said these policies have to be based on returning a beef price to farmers above the costs of production; securing a premium price for a quality product; delivering a fairer share of the consumer price back to the farmer; a strong CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) with targeted direct payments; and ensuring that the European and Irish beef sector are not undermined with sub-standard South American beef imports.
He asked the Committee & the Minister for Agriculture to request the intervention of the Competition & Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to carry out a report on the lack of competition in the beef processing sector.

https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/ifa-call-on-govt-eu-to-compensate-farmers-for-brexit-beef-losses/,2019-04-15,IFA Call on Govt & EU to Compensate Farmers for Brexit Beef Losses,"Speaking at a large IFA meeting of cattle farmers in Portlaoise tonight (Mon), IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said beef farmers have been savaged financially over the last year by Brexit related price cuts.
Angus Woods said farmers are furious with the way they have been ignored by the Government and hammered by the factories on prices.
  Angus Woods said the IFA has analysed the data and put a detailed set of proposals to both Minister Creed and Commissioner Hogan on the losses of over €100m in the beef sector. “Minister Creed needs to make the beef issue and the Brexit losses his priority at the EU Farm Council in Brussels and at the Cabinet table in Dublin.”
  “We have met with the officials in the Department of Agriculture and the EU Commission and they accept that Irish beef farmers have incurred significant Brexit beef losses.”
  Angus Woods said beef farmers have gone through a horrendous period of financial losses and some of these farmers are facing ruin. Without a fair Brexit aid package, they will go to the wall.
  He said beef farmers have been hit by cattle price cuts of €100 per head on steers and heifers and €200 per head and more on young bulls.
  Angus Woods said IFA has written to both Minister Creed and Commissioner Hogan outlining the details on the €101m losses. “Farmers expect that they will honour the commitments they have made over the last number of months. They must now convert these commitments into real delivery and cover the Brexit losses farmers have already incurred to date.”
  “This is the real test for the Government and the EU Commission on their promises to support farmers through this most difficult period.”
  The IFA analysis of the losses beef farmers have already incurred cover the period from September 1st 2018 up to March 23rd 2019.
  IFA has calculated the losses based on comparing cattle prices in 2015 (pre-Brexit) to the very low prices farmers received in the autumn of 2018 and the winter/spring of 2019. For steers, heifers and young bulls, prices are based on the official Bord Bia reported R3 price. For cows the O3 grade price comparison was used. Department of Agriculture weekly cattle numbers at the meat plants and average carcase weights were used in the calculations.
  He said IFA has put these losses to both Minister Creed and Commissioner Hogan and they must immediately come forward with a direct support aid package to cover the losses incurred. He said “These farm families have major financial bills with banks, merchants and others and they cannot be left hung out to dry.”"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-welcomes-oireachtas-committee-opposition-to-mercosur-trade-deal/,2019-06-25,IFA Welcomes Oireachtas Committee Opposition to Mercosur Trade Deal,"Reacting to the publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee report on the future of the beef sector, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the report was a mixed bag, with some positive recommendations and some missed opportunities to address the income crisis in the sector.
Angus Woods said in the detailed submission made by IFA, we made it very clear to the Committee that the ‘single biggest challenge in the beef sector is the income crisis at farm level’.
Welcoming the stance of the Committee on their opposition to the EU-Mercosur deal, Angus Woods said with the developments in Brussels this week, Committee members must make it crystal clear at this stage they will vote down a Mercosur deal with beef in it, when it comes before the Dail.
He called on members of the Committee to make it clear to the Taoiseach and Minister Creed today that a Mercosur deal will not get through the Dail.
In relation to the lack of competition in the beef sector, Angus Woods said its disappointing that the Committee failed to call on Minister Creed to direct the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to investigate the sector.
Angus Woods said the absence of any recommendation on the need for increased support for the important suckler cow herd is a missed opportunity, considering that all the political parties have indicated their support for sucklers.
On CAP, Angus Woods said the Agriculture Committee needs to make it clear to Minister Creed and the Government that under no circumstances can a cut in the CAP Budget be tolerated. “CAP direct payments are vital for the beef and livestock sector and farmers need an increase in the CAP Budget.”
On Brexit, Angus Woods said the facts are beef is more exposed than any other sector and we cannot face another cliff edge in October. He said farmers are facing the third year of Brexit uncertainty and bad prices, and it is totally unfair that farmers are expected to carry all the risks
Angus Woods welcomed the recommendation in the report on the need for additional support for the live export trade, which he said is essential for price competition and additional market outlets.
  In relation to the QPS and grading, the IFA livestock leader said it is essential that farmers are properly rewarded for quality production.  He said IFA has made specific proposals for a suckler beef price premium. He added the Minister for Agriculture must guarantee that farmers are getting the correct grade for their cattle in the meat plants.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/urgent-changes-needed-in-ministers-proposed-e100m-beef-scheme/,2019-07-12,Urgent Changes Needed in Minister’s Proposed €100m Beef Scheme,"IFA President Joe Healy said urgent changes are needed to the details of the €100m scheme proposed by Minister Creed yesterday.  IFA set out six principles for the distribution of the fund and the scheme should fully reflect these.
IFA put these principles clearly to Minister Creed at the consultation meeting yesterday.
“The Minister must take feedback on board, make the necessary changes and then move to pay out the money as soon as possible. It is imperative that the scheme is designed in such a way that every single cent of €100m committed by the EU Commission and the Irish Government is paid out to farmers,” he said.
“The Minister has said the scheme will cover losses up to May 10th, but prices since then have continued to fall and are now on the floor. The Minister needs to put the Commission on notice that another fund will be needed to cover on-going losses,” he said.
As regards the details of the scheme, he said IFA has been consistent that funds should go to the farmers who suffered the losses. This is the basis for the six principles that were endorsed at eight regional meetings (see below).
“The scheme should be able to exclude factory feedlots, factory-owned cattle and dealers. If these can be excluded, then the per head and overall payment limits, particularly for cattle supplied post-Christmas, should be looked at for genuine beef finishers. Farmers who finished cattle in the reference period made a big investment buying cattle.  They need to be able to clear their stocking loans and be back in the market for stores and weanlings in the autumn. The scale of losses experienced by some of these farmers is shocking,” he said.
“The exclusion of prime beef animals (steers, heifers and young bulls) from all mixed enterprise farms involving beef and dairy production is wrong, bearing in mind that farmers involved in other commodities or professions are eligible. These animals must be included for payment,” he said.
It is important that the scheme has a provision to take account of force majeure circumstances.
“The Minister should take the feedback on board and move quickly to settle the scheme and get the money out to farmers,” he said.
Six principles for distribution of €100m Beef Fund
For beef farmers and must be paid to beef farmers. Not for factories, factory feedlots or factory-owned cattle, agents or dealers.
Targeted to the farmers who incurred the losses and the sectors who need it most in terms of income.
Farmers who sold prime finished cattle – steers, heifers, young bulls since last Autumn, and suckler farmers.
Paid out quickly and directly to farmers.
Finished cattle sold in the marts must be included.
DAFM has all the data on the AIMs system to enable accurate targeting of the funds."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-call-on-factories-to-stop-the-beef-price-cuts/,2019-07-15,IFA Call on Factories to Stop the Beef Price Cuts,"IFA National Livestock Chairman, Angus Woods confirmed today (15th July) that IFA has been in contact with the senior management in the main beef factory groups and made it clear that beef price cuts will not be tolerated. He said IFA also informed them that they must restore prices to viable levels.
He said farmer confidence is on the floor and the factories have to immediately stop the price cuts, which are exploiting a very difficult market situation.
He said beef farmers are very angry with what they see as the factories’ refusal to support beef farmers at this difficult time. “This is not only undermining the confidence of beef and suckler farmers at a critical time for the future of the sector, it is also undermining prices and the value of our beef in the market place”.
Angus Woods said, “This drive to the bottom on price is inflicting severe financial hardship on farmers and sending the wrong signal to the market place, undermining the value of our product and our production standards”.
“This week the base price for steers is €3.60 and €3.70 for heifers. Some factories are attempting to quote lower prices, but are having to pay more than the quotes.”
The IFA Livestock leader said farmers with quality prime cattle are strongly resisting the price cuts and insisting that they get more than the loss-making quoted price."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/urgent-measures-needed-to-address-eu-brexit-beef-crisis/,2019-07-18,Urgent Measures Needed to Address EU Brexit Beef Crisis,"IFA President Joe Healy said the EU Commission must act now on the EU Brexit beef crisis, stop substandard beef imports into Europe and also make the €1bn available immediately for direct aid and market supports.
“With cattle prices on the floor and sterling reaching new lows of 90 pence to the euro, urgent action is needed to deal with the very severe crisis in the EU beef sector,” he said.
“Beef prices this week are at €3.60/kg, down 10% from the same day last year when prices were already appalling.”
The EU Commission announced much-needed aid in May, but this only covers the period from September to May this year. More aid is needed immediately and a clear contingency plan must be put in place as we lead up to a potentially catastrophic no deal Brexit at the end of October,” he said.
“Commissioner Hogan has committed that the EU will make up to €1bn available in the event of the recently-announced Mercosur trade deal having a negative impact. The Commission needs to bring this funding on stream now to provide further direct aid to cover Brexit losses and to activate EU market supports immediately to put a floor under EU markets. It is clear that genuine market support measures will need to be in place sooner rather than later,” he said.
“We are being constantly told that the Commission ‘has the tools’ to address market disturbance. Well it’s time to use them before Irish farming is beyond repair,” he said.
Mr. Healy said the EU Commission has explained that ‘a red button’ mechanism is in place to stop substandard imports. “The Commission needs to push the red button now and stop substandard beef which is already coming in from South America. Last year, some 269,000t of beef came into the EU despite serious shortcomings in the standard of that beef,” he said.
The facts are that in Brazil cattle are not tagged and there is no traceability. Hormones, beta agonists and other growth promoters are widely available. These products are all illegal and banned in the EU. Brazil has endemic Foot and Mouth disease, which is a constant risk.
“Despite assurances by the Commission over the recent trade deal, the one thing we know is that Mercosur is currently failing to meet EU standards.  Two weeks ago, Commissioner Hogan assured European producers and consumers ‘no product will be allowed enter the EU market unless it complies 100% with EU standards’. The Commission should call stop on these imports now and insist they meet EU standards.” he said.
“While we appreciate the importance of trade, Europe has been over generous with these countries by turning a blind eye to double standards, including a report from their own Food and Veterinary Office which states ‘written guarantees’ given by the Brazilian authorities were ‘not reliable’” he said.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/substantially-more-funding-and-supports-needed-for-beef-sector-in-crisis-ifa/,2019-07-29,Substantially More Funding and Supports Needed for Beef Sector in Crisis – IFA,"SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FUNDING AND SUPPORTS NEEDED FOR BEEF SECTOR IN CRISIS – IFA
IFA President Joe Healy said today (29 July) that given the increasing threat of a no-deal Brexit, substantially more EU and Government funding and supports will be needed for the beef sector.
Joe Healy was responding to the details announced by Minister Creed this morning for the distribution of the €100m fund, first announced by Commissioner Hogan last May.
He said farmers urgently need more support and a clear roadmap from Brussels and Dublin as to how they will support the agricultural sector, should a no-deal Brexit come to pass.
The scheme announced today covers losses from 24th September 2018 to May 10th 2019. While this is important, unfortunately prices have deteriorated much further since May, with base prices down by 45c/kg or €160/Hd.
IFA is calling on the Government and EU Commission to immediately;
Secure further direct aid support for farmers to deal with losses incurred, particularly for beef farmers, post-May 2019. These ongoing losses are due to the decline in the value of sterling and market disturbance arising from Brexit uncertainty.
Make available the €1bn EU fund immediately to stabilise the Irish and EU beef market, which is now in crisis.
Ban the importation of 270,000t of Mercosur beef imports from south America, which has consistently failed to meet European standards in audits by the EU Food and Veterinary Office.
In the event of a no-deal/hard Brexit which reduces market access and increases barriers to trade, the EU must make available structural and adjustment funding. In this context State-aid rules must be set aside.
Secure increased funding for the CAP in the next MFF 2021-2027.
Reject the proposal to cut the Irish allocation by €97m pa and seek an increase to take account of inflation and the extra demands on farmers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be further issues in terms of a shortfall in 2020, EU or national funding may be required in this instance.
IFA President Joe Healy said beef farmers are now in dire straits with the threat of a no-deal Brexit causing mayhem in the EU Beef market, which is now in crisis.
On the €100m scheme itself he said that while he welcomed the fact that animals controlled by factories were excluded, he was concerned that the limits and conditions put in place by Minister Creed could lead to an under spend of the fund.
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “The Minister has said that the payment rate to farmers might be cut if the scheme is over spent. We want a commitment from the Minister that if the money is underspent, that he will re-look at some of the limits and restrictions, or increase the payment rate. It would be a travesty if some this funding went unspent due to restrictions put in place by the Minister,” he said.
“The Minister could have paid this funding on all prime cattle (young bulls, steers and heifers) as set out in IFA’s six principles and ensured the fund was fully spent. We would be concerned that the way the scheme is now structured will result in the fund being underspent,” said Angus Woods."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/stop-the-beef-import-scandal-which-is-damaging-eu-beef-prices/,2019-07-31,Stop the Beef Import Scandal Which Is Damaging EU Beef Prices,"IFA’s National Council and Livestock Committee members today (Wednesday 31st July), are holding a protest at the EU Food & Veterinary Offices, in Grange, Co. Meath.
Speaking at the protest, IFA President Joe Healy said, “The crisis in the beef sector is an EU-wide problem driven by Brexit uncertainty and falling consumption. This is compounded by substandard imports coming into the EU. The situation is now intolerable for farmers and solutions must come from Brussels and the Irish Government.”
Joe Healy said the first move by the EU must be to stop substandard imports, which are undermining the EU beef market.
While farmers have rightly been outraged at the recent EU/Mercosur trade deal, which has yet to be ratified, the real scandal is that significant quantities of substandard beef from Brazil are already coming onto the EU market,” he said.
“Beef is being produced in Brazil using substances and practices which are illegal in the EU. This is ‘unfair competition’ and it is damaging cattle prices and farm incomes, not only in Ireland but across the EU”.
In 2017, the EU Commission- Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), based here in Co. Meath, issued a report highlighting that the Brazilian competent authority was not able to guarantee that the relevant EU requirements are being met. The report states that previous ‘written guarantees’ given by the Brazilian authorities to the EU were ‘not reliable’”.
“In 2018 270,000 tonnes of substandard beef imports come into the EU market at an average rate of 22,500 per month and this has continued in 2019” he said.
The IFA President said the facts are;
Brazilian cattle are not tagged or identified and there is no traceability.
Hormones, beta agonists and other growth promoters are widely available. These products are all illegal and banned in the EU.
Brazil is burning the equivalent size of one football pitch of rainforest every minute, to expand beef production.
Brazil has endemic Foot and Mouth disease, which is a constant risk.
Irish and European beef producers, who produce beef to the highest standards in the world are looking at their livelihoods being wiped out, not because a better product exists at a cheaper price, but because the EC is turning a blind eye to flagrant production violations in return for South American market access.
In addition to this request, the IFA also demanding that Commissioner Hogan make €1bn available immediately in the form of direct aid and market supports to address the beef crisis.
The urgent measures being sought by IFA are:
An immediate ban on all substandard South American beef imports
A further fund to compensate farmers who supplied cattle post-May 12th 2019 and are currently losing €4m per week on beef prices
€1bn Brexit fund of market supports and direct aid for farmers
An EU campaign to promote our environmentally sustainable EU beef production.
Angus Woods, IFA Livestock Chairman said, “Commissioner Hogan has consistently said the Commission has the tools to address market disturbance. Brexit is already causing huge uncertainty and currency volatility. The Commission needs to bring forward the €1bn fund now, to provide strong market supports and direct aid for farmers”.

He said, “Minister Creed’s appeal to businesses in the Agri-Food sector, ‘to make sure that they know exactly what they will need to do in a “No Deal” scenario, and make the necessary preparations now’, does not inspire farmers’ confidence at a time when we are facing a potential wipe-out”.
“It’s akin to the captain of a ship going to sea without any lifeboats for the passengers.”
“Neither the Minister, Taoiseach, Tánaiste nor any member of cabinet has been able to provide us with concrete details as to how farmers’ livelihoods will be safeguarded in the event of a crash-out Brexit. The Minister is saying nothing about his plans to protect Irish farmers, who are in the front line and the most exposed in Europe.”
The IFA President said, “IFA has set out clearly in our pre-Budget submission what is needed to prevent the sector from Armageddon. We are 90 days out from a potential no-deal Brexit, and the EU and the Government must commit to IFA’s package of measures, and support Ireland’s farmers”.
“The recent collapse of Sterling has already hit cattle prices. We are down 40c/kg or over €150 per head on this time last year, when prices had already been decimated. If we don’t have an EU support package in place and the UK crashes out in October, we are facing the potential wipe-out of beef production in this country,” he said.
Joe Healy called on Government to set out their plan for “No Deal”, rather than attempting to shift the focus from its lack of clarity around what will happen if Boris Johnson follows through on his threat to leave the EU on 31st October, deal or no deal."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-comment-on-factory-protests/,2019-08-06,IFA Comment on Factory Protests,"IFA’s National Council debated the current beef and farm income crisis at its most recent meeting on July 19th.
IFA President Joe Healy said several different strategies were discussed. The Council considered many factors including the current beef price and depressed market conditions across Europe and in the UK, and the increasing risk of a ‘no deal’ Brexit on October 31st.
“While the Council fully understands the frustration and anger of beef farmers, the view was that the best strategy at this time to get further meaningful results for our members is to continue to focus our lobbying efforts on the EU institutions and the Irish Government. This approach secured €100m, which will be very welcome for suckler and beef farmers despite the inclusion of some unnecessary restrictions,” he said.
The following urgent measures are being sought by IFA:
An immediate ban on all substandard South American beef imports;
A further fund to compensate farmers who supplied cattle post May 12th, 2019 and are currently losing €4m per week on beef prices;
€1bn Brexit fund of market supports and direct aid for farmers;
An EU campaign to promote our environmentally sustainable EU beef production.
As individuals, IFA members are free to make their own decisions regarding the current factory protests or to withhold their cattle and sheep. However, farmers who need to sell their cattle or sheep should be allowed to do so.
IFA wrote to the Beef Plan Group on July 10th. We made it clear that we were in favour of farmer unity and that we would be happy to engage with them. We have not received a reply to date."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/make-sure-to-apply-for-e100m-beam-scheme-before-sept-8th/,2019-08-23,Make Sure to Apply for €100m BEAM Scheme Before Sept 8th,"IFA President Joe Healy has strongly encouraged all eligible beef and suckler farmers to apply for the €100m BEAM (Beef Exceptional Aid Measure) before the closing date of Sun, September 8th.
Joe Healy said online applications are open now and farmers should make sure to have their application completed and submitted before the closing date. He said any farmer that does not have access to a computer should seek assistance from the Department of Agriculture, Teagasc, their private planner or IFA.
  He said the €100m scheme, which was secured by IFA, is worth €100 per finished animal and €40 per suckler cow.
  Joe Healy said farmers who sold finished cattle in the marts are also eligible for the €100 payment. “IFA insisted on finished cattle sold through the marts being eligible. The scheme specifies that where cattle have been presented for slaughter by an agent or dealer within 30 days of purchase, including those purchased in a mart, payment may issue to the immediate previous herdowner.”
  He said it is essential that any farmer who sold finished cattle through a mart or directly to a dealer or agent make an application under the scheme.
  IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “IFA campaigned very hard to secure this €100m funding. It’s essential that all eligible farmers apply. All of the money must be drawn down and paid out to farmers as soon as possible as they are in real financial need because of the crisis in the sector”.
  He said despite some of the restrictive conditions imposed by Minister Creed and the EU Commission, farmers should make an application and the Minister must ensure that the €100m is paid out in full.
  Based on data presented by the Department of Agriculture, over 37,000 beef finishers and 55,000 suckler farmers are eligible.
  Angus Woods said the scheme covers cattle sold between September 24th 2018 and May 12th 2019 and sucklers cows with progeny born in 2018. He said with cattle prices still on the floor, it is essential Minister Creed secures another aid package for beef farmers to offset the ongoing severe Brexit losses on cattle sold since May 12th.

https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/ifa-president-seeks-urgent-meeting-with-competition-authority/,2019-08-27,IFA President Seeks Urgent Meeting with Competition Authority,"IFA President Joe Healy has written to the Chair of the Competition Authority, Isolde Goggin seeking an urgent meeting to clarify the CCPC’s position on cattle prices being discussed at beef talks.
“We understand that the Beef Group were advised that they would have to accept a pre-condition that prices could not be discussed before entering into the most recent talks,” he said.
“We are unclear why such a precondition applied, and we want an explanation from the CCPC” he said.
“The Minister has asked IFA to re-enter talks, but we need clarity on this point. It is IFA’s view that talks without price being on the table is a waste of time and makes a mockery of beef farmers” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-must-get-the-meat-factories-to-come-forward-with-real-proposals/,2019-08-30,Minister Must Get the Meat Factories to Come Forward with Real Proposals,"Following today’s events where farmers were hauled before the courts by meat factories, IFA President Joe Healy said the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed should stop telling the farm organisations what to do and instead instruct the meat factories to come forward with proposals to bring full transparency to the sector.
“We spent the morning in the High Court and then we listened to Minister Creed this evening explaining that he had contacted all the farm organisations, but not Meat Industry Ireland,” he said.
“The Minister has to call in the meat factories and insist that they come forward with realistic measures around transparency and price that will improve the income of beef farmers. There is no point in having talks unless there are serious proposals on the table,” he said.
  “The Minister himself also needs to address the looming Brexit crisis by putting real money on the table. The €100m provided already will be nowhere near enough. We need specific proposals on the table from the Minister to give farmers some reassurance as we face the biggest ever threat to Irish farming,” he said.
  The IFA President said that the IFA have set out four key areas that require urgent attention:
An immediate ban on all substandard South American beef imports;
A further fund to compensate farmers who supplied cattle post May 12th, 2019 and are currently losing €4m per week on beef prices;
€1bn Brexit fund of market supports and direct aid for farmers;
An EU campaign to promote our environmentally sustainable EU beef production.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-calls-for-government-commission-of-investigation-into-the-beef-sector/,2019-09-02,IFA Calls for Government Commission of Investigation into the Beef Sector,"IFA President Joe Healy has called on the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to establish a statutory Commission of Investigation into the beef sector to establish processor and retailer margins along the supply chain.
Mr. Healy said that the terms of reference would have to be agreed with farmers, but the Commission should have full access to the books of the meat processors and be able to establish what they are paid for each part of the beef animal. “Full transparency on the price along the chain must be an essential element of the investigation,” he said.
Joe Healy said if this was done alongside a price commitment from the factories and an assurance from Minister Creed to put a Brexit support scheme in place for all farmers who sold cattle after May 12th, it could provide a basis for a resolution to the current stalemate.
The Commission must also be able to verify if certain specifications are being demanded by retailer customers and if this justifies these being applied in respect of cattle prices.  It should also look at what is going on with factory-controlled feed lots and how these are being used to manipulate cattle prices
The Commission must have the power to compel witnesses to appear and should also get access to financial information from processors and retailers to establish the profit margin they are making from beef.
“A number of months ago, IFA engaged economist Jim Power to investigate some of these matters. While he has made a progress on many matters, it is clear that without being able to access financial data from the meat plants and retailers, it is not be possible to definitively determine what the processor and retail margins are,” he said.
“With the statutory powers of a Commission of investigation, if the Government moved on this it should be able establish answers to these questions relatively quickly. Farmers are entitled to know the truth about who is making what from their cattle in the beef supply chain.” he said.
The report of the Commission could form the basis of a new price transparency index which would provide on-going data on margins in the sector.  “If we are to establish any trust between farmers, processors and retailers, this is a necessary first step,” he said.
 "
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-position-on-30-month-specification/,2019-09-13,IFA Position on 30-month Specification,"IFA President Joe Healy has clarified the IFA position on the 30-month age rule and other criteria applied by factories for farmers to receive a 12c/kg ‘In-spec’ bonus payment.
Joe Healy said “The IFA position has always been that all prime cattle from Quality Assured herds should receive a QA bonus, with no other additional specification or criteria, such as the 30 months age limit.” IFA put this position very strongly to Minister Creed and the factories at the beef talks.
Along with membership of the QA Scheme, the 30-month requirement is one of four other criteria applied by factories to qualify for the 12c per kg ‘In Spec’ bonus payment.
These additional criteria are:
animals under 30 months of age;
maximum four farm residencies;
70-day residency prior to slaughter;
grades of O= or better, and between 2+ and 4= fat score.
To justify these specs, the meat factories have stated that these are demanded by some other countries and by some retailers, particularly in the UK. This position has been supported by Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture.
The 30-month rule has its origins in the BSE crisis. Time has moved on and there is no longer any veterinary basis for the rule. However, some countries and some UK retailers continue to have it as a requirement. If we want to supply their markets, we have to meet their specifications.
As part of the original agreement in Backweston on August 21st, it was agreed that ‘An in-depth review of market and customer criteria in relation to the four In-Spec bonus criteria will be carried out’.
This position was accepted by all the farmer representatives present on the night on the basis that we needed to understand the full consequences for Irish cattle prices and market access of removing or adjusting any or all of the four specifications.
The IFA National Council and National Livestock Committee met this week and supported the in-depth review agreed with Minister Creed.  They made it clear that if the review shows that these specifications are not justified, then they should be removed.
The IFA President said throughout this beef crisis, farmers have been fed a huge amount of false and misleading information. This has raised completely unrealistic expectations. There has been a lot of talk about ‘leadership’ during this crisis. Leadership is about more than just telling people what they want to hear."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmer-unity-important-in-achieving-outcome-in-beef-talks/,2019-09-15,Farmer Unity Important in Achieving Outcome in Beef Talks,"IFA President Joe Healy said that after a difficult weekend of negotiations, a realistic and deliverable agreement has been reached, and will be recommended by all organisations.
“During a difficult endgame to the talks, the farm organisations stood together to get the best available outcome for farmers,” he said.
“This is far from a perfect deal. While there are some aspects which will make a difference immediately, there are others that will require a lot of further work,” he said.
Joe Healy said the key elements of the agreement include additional bonuses for In spec cattle and cattle between 30 and 36 months. As part of ensuring greater transparency, a Beef Price Index will be rolled out from next week to provide greater transparency on cattle prices.
Details of the agreement include:
an increase in the in-spec bonus for steers and heifers from 12c/kg to 20c/kg.
a new bonus of 8c/kg for steers and heifers aged between 30 to 36 months, which meet all non-age related existing in-spec criteria, and which up to now have not received any bonus;
a new in-spec bonus of 12c/kg for steers and heifers under 30 months which grade O- and fat class 4+.
Reduction in the in-spec 70-day residency requirement to 60 days on the last farm.
A new Beef Market Price index from Bord Bia covering cattle prices and beef market prices from our main export markets and offal prices.
IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said a Beef Market Task Force will be set up and independently chaired to oversee the implementation of all the elements in the agreement, with clear timelines and full stakeholder engagement.
The agreement also includes;
an immediate scientific review of the Quality Payment Grid by Teagasc;
an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in relation to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector;
an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, along the supply chain.
a summary of competition law issues as relevant to the Irish beef sector.
Bord Bia will further intensify promotional activity for Irish beef across key EU markets and China and develop a PGI (Protected Geographical Indicator) for Irish beef.
In advance of the implementation of a new EU Regulation on price reporting across the EU, DAFM will provide additional detailed price reporting on the Beef PriceWatch app.
A consultation process will be launched shortly on the transposition of the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Directive,including consideration of the requirement for an independent regulator.
DAFM will report its carcass classification inspection results on a regular basis. An appeals system for manual grading factories is being introduced.
Teagasc will review the hot/cold weighing system.
DAFM will support the development of beef Producer Organisations.
DAFM will continue to support the Live export trade.

https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/clock-ticking-to-avoid-brexit-armageddon/,2019-09-17,Clock Ticking to Avoid Brexit Armageddon,"Speaking on the opening day of the Ploughing Championships, IFA President Joe Healy welcomed the support of NFU President Minette Batters at the opening day of the Ploughing Championships.
“Minette Batters is here today to stand with Irish farmers against the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, with potentially disastrous consequences for farmers here and across the water,” he said.
Today’s report from the Central Bank is a very stark reminder of the devastation that a hard Brexit would cause at farm level.
Yesterday, Joe Healy met with UFU President, Ivor Ferguson and the NFU President on the farm of Owen Martin in Newry, Co. Down.  “We are fast approaching the risk of a no-deal, cliff edge Brexit on 31st October, that would be catastrophic for farmers across the island of Ireland and in mainland UK”.
“We are clear that Brexit can only go ahead on the basis of a Withdrawal Agreement and a transition period, that would provide for a standstill in trading relations, avoiding a hard border in Ireland and maintaining the existing close and interdependent trading relationships that currently exist between the EU and the UK.”
“As regards current discussions on alternative arrangements to the backstop, full regulatory and customs alignment is necessary to avoid a hard border in Ireland and to protect the integrity of the single market.”
Joe Healy said it is clear that Irish and UK farmers are absolutely united in the desire to avoid a ‘no deal’ and a hard border and in their view that it would be devastating for farmers and very bad for consumers if the UK was to cut its standards and aim for a cheap food policy.
The IFA President said the Government and EU must immediately announce details of how Irish farmers will be supported if Boris Johnson takes the UK out of the EU on 31st October, without a deal. “IFA has set out clearly in our pre-Budget submission what is needed to prevent the sector from Armageddon. We are 44 days out from a potential no-deal Brexit, and the EU and the Government must commit to IFA’s package of measures, and support Ireland’s farmers”.
The recent collapse of Sterling has already hit cattle prices. We are down 40c/kg or over €150 per head on this time last year, when prices had already been decimated. If we don’t have an EU support package in place and the UK crashes out in October, we are facing the potential wipe-out of beef production in this country,” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/time-for-factories-to-open-and-step-up-on-base-price/,2019-09-19,Time for Factories to Open and Step Up on Base Price,"IFA President Joe Healy says that while base price was discussed at the talks at the weekend no price could be agreed due to Ireland’s flawed competition law. IFA and other farm organisations did raise the issue with the Minister at the talks. We stressed that the success of the agreement, on the ground, would very much depend on the factories approach on the base price.
With the immediate gains in the agreement being around bonuses, the potential for factories to undermine these by manipulating the base price was an obvious concern.
“I would now urge the factories to re-open and to come forward with a strong base price. This would help to start the process of building some sort of trust and to get the industry up and running” he said.
The industry should fully re-open. Farmers with animals to sell should contact their factories and drive the hardest possible bargain on the base price.
“IFA will fully support any farmer who wants to sell their animals,” he said.
“The new beef price index will be available from this week and that should be a help in providing more transparency on cattle prices in the weeks ahead,” he said.
“Some other immediate gains were achieved in Sunday’s agreement, but much of what was agreed will take time to implement.
“The independent review of specifications, including; the 30-month age limit, the four movements and the residency period will be very important for many farmers. IFA is clear that if the review shows that these cannot be justified on the grounds of market access, then they should be abolished immediately,” he said.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-meets-uk-farm-unions-on-brexit-and-the-beef-crisis/,2019-09-27,IFA Meets UK Farm Unions on Brexit and the Beef Crisis,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has met with the leaders of the UK NFU Livestock Committees in Belfast to discuss Brexit and the price and income problems in the beef sector.
“Farm organisations from Britain and Ireland are extremely concerned about the severe consequences of a no-deal Brexit and the possibility of a flood of sub-standard South American imports damaging the beef sector,” he said.
He said the uncertainty caused by Brexit has destabilised and damaged the beef market from the consumer right back down the supply chain to the producer.
“It is very clear from our discussions that beef farmers all across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are under severe income pressure as a result of unviable low beef prices.”
“Our farming colleagues across the UK are clear beef that prices have to rise.  Farmers cannot stay producing beef at below the cost of production. Retailers and processors must respond and return a higher price back to the farmer.”
Ahead of an important European meeting of livestock farmers with the EU Commission in Brussels next week, Angus Woods said, “we discussed the need to turn up the pressure on the Commission over the ever-increasing volumes of sub-standard South American imports damaging the EU market and prices. The facts are these imports fail to meet EU standards and must be banned”.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said he also had discussions with the NFU livestock leaders from Wales regarding the ongoing and similar income challenges livestock farmers in Wales and Ireland are facing over unviable cattle prices.
The meeting of the UK and Irish livestock leaders was attended by the IFA (Irish Farmers Association), UFU (Ulster Farmers Union), NFU England and Wales (National Farmers Union) and NFUS (National Farmers Union Scotland)."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/cattle-price-rise-justified-based-on-rising-market-returns/,2019-11-07,Cattle Price Rise Justified Based on Rising Market Returns,"  IFA President Joe Healy said factories need to increase the base price of beef on the back of rising cattle prices in our main export markets in the UK and across the EU, and higher demand for the Christmas trade.
  “The facts are during the month of October, factories pulled cattle prices by 3c-5c/kg for prime cattle and 15c/kg for cows. However, prime cattle prices in the UK have stabilised and when the strength of sterling is accounted for, prices have risen by 10c-13c/kg,” he said.
  Cattle prices are also rising across some of the main EU markets, with young bull prices up 35c/kg in Italy, up 18c/kg in Spain and little or no change in Germany and France.
  Joe Healy again called for the immediate publication of the Bord Bia Beef Price Index. “IFA pushed hard for this index at the beef talks to keep the factories honest. It was agreed the index would be published from Sept 16th. We need it urgently.”
  Joe Healy was highly critical of some factories for the price pull on heifers over recent days. He said the ABP group have led the charge in trying to pull the base price for heifers back down to the same level as steers.
 "
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/new-beef-price-index-shows-irish-farmers-are-due-an-increase/,2019-11-20,New Beef Price Index Shows Irish Farmers Are Due an Increase,"IFA President Joe Healy said that the new beef price indices published by Bord Bia show that the beef market is improving and that farmers must get an immediate price increase.
The new data includes a number of elements including an index for the retail and wholesale value of beef in our main export markets and an offal index. It also compares Irish beef prices with a new ‘European benchmark price for prime cattle’ based on a weighted average of cattle prices in our main export markets.
“There is a clear gap of 17c/kg between the new European (prime export benchmark) price and Irish prices, which has opened up since early August. This is unacceptable,” he said.
“The new indices will provide greater transparency on cattle and beef prices and help to keep the factories honest in terms of market trends. This is the first version and I’m sure it will be further refined as we go along,” he said.
“The latest data shows that Irish farmers can now justifiably demand and expect an immediate price increase,” he said.
“The index will provide greater transparency on cattle and beef prices and keep the factories honest in terms of market trends. This is the first version and I’m sure it will be further refined as we go along,” he said.
“One of the biggest complaints of beef farmers is the lack of up-to-date information about the price of beef in our main markets. This Index will equip farmers with comprehensive details about beef price trends and arm them with market data when they are selling cattle,” he said.
The new Price Index also includes a monthly Wholesale/Retail Beef Price Index, which again shows for the month from September to October these prices across the UK and EU markets increased.
Joe Healy said the Index also includes a By Product Market Indicator, which tracks changes in the values of hides and offal. Currently this is showing a value equivalent to 29c/kg, which is up marginally from its low point in June of 25c/kg."

“Talking to factory agents over the weekend, it’s clear that the factories intend there to be little or no price increases again this week. This is unacceptable,” he said.
Mr. Healy said that the new Beef Price tracker indices published last week by Bord Bia show that Irish beef farmers are due a price increase, with Irish beef prices now 17c behind the Bord Bia Prime Export Benchmark price.
“Beef prices in our main export market in the UK have turned the corner and are rising. In addition, sterling has strengthened considerably in recent weeks. UK cattle prices are at the equivalent of €4.07/kg incl. vat., which is 45c/kg or €162 per head more than Irish prices, which are stuck at €3.62/kg incl. vat.
“An agreement was reached between farmers, MII and Minister Creed on September 15th last. One of the objectives of the agreement was to improve trust between factories and farmers. Since then, the factories have introduced severe weight penalties, kept legal threats in place and now the Irish beef price is lagging behind other countries. Relations between factories and farmers have actually worsened since September 15th and the Minister has sided with the factories by accepting their petty explanation for keeping legal threats in place” he said.
“The agreement brokered in September commits all parties to bringing disputes to the Beef Taskforce before they are escalated. As the Beef Taskforce has not been able to meet, due to the failure to lift all legal threats against farmers, we are putting Meat Industry Ireland and the Minister on notice that farmers have had enough of the carry on by the meat factories. We need a significant price increase now and we need the Minister Creed and the Government, who provide support the meat industry in multiple ways, to tell the factories to cop themselves on,” he said.
Joe Healy was also very critical of the Minister for Agriculture in respect of the Brexit BEAM scheme, which was put in place by Brussels and the Government to help compensate farmers for beef price losses.
“Unnecessary restrictions put in place by the Minister have resulted in over €20m of this money not being applied for. This money must get to farmers and we need a scheme to cover losses post-May 12th,” he said.
“Despite being announced as far back as May this year, the Minister has not paid out any of the BEAM scheme funds to farmers yet.  The Minister must pay out these funds immediately as beef farm incomes are on the floor,” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-president-makes-price-increase-the-priority-at-beef-task-force/,2019-12-03,IFA President Makes Price Increase the Priority at Beef Task Force,"The IFA President Joe Healy said IFA made an immediate and significant cattle price increase the priority issue at the Beef Task Force meeting in Dublin today.
“IFA put a cattle price increase on the table at the very start of the meeting.”
“The meat factories representative accepted the facts verified by the Bord Bia beef price index, that market prices have increased and cattle prices should increase in the short term.”
“IFA demanded an immediate and significant price increase, and highlighted the anger of farmers that factories had held back on justified price increases over recent weeks.”
“The Task Force accepted that there is a significant gap between Irish prices and those in our export markets.”
He said it was also agreed that market reports and beef and cattle prices will be part of the terms of reference of the Task Force.
He said the Beef Price Index will be produced weekly by Bord Bia.
On a request from the IFA, it was agreed that the Department of Agriculture will carry out an analysis on the impact of weight and age restrictions on the new In-spec bonuses since September 15th. It was pointed out that while the bonuses were implemented, this was not reflected in a price increase because of these restrictions.
IFA also raised specific issues around maximising live exports, progress on the beef price index, independent reports on the In-spec bonuses and the total value of the animal in the chain, retailers attending the Task Force, mechanical classification and the need for an independent appeals system."

Time for factories to abandon ‘price-setting Friday’
Tesco ‘half price beef’ an insult to farmers
IFA this morning blockaded the Tesco central distribution centre in Donabate, Co Dublin as part of the ongoing farmer campaign for an increase in beef prices.
The protest will last 12 hours and follows similar action at the Aldi and Lidl central distribution centres last week.
IFA President Joe Healy said last week’s statement by Larry Goodman’s ABP group that they would increase prices, bizarrely, contained no specific figure. This is typical of the lack of transparency from meat factories.
“From talking to farmers, it would seem that generally the price rises appear to be 5c/kg for heifers and 10c/kg for steers. This still leaves the Irish price well short of the Bord Bia EU Benchmark and it remains over 50c off the UK price as their market continues to strengthen. The UK price increased again last week and sterling improved to 84p/€ last Friday,” he said.
“It is clear, based on market increases, that the factories including ABP could have increased cattle prices some weeks ago, but they did not. Instead, they pocketed the increases for themselves and refused to pass it back to farmers. MII representing the factories adopted the same stalling tactic at the Beef Taskforce.”
“Farmers are also appalled to see Tesco advertising ‘half price’ beef in the last few days. This unsustainable discounting puts downward pressure on beef prices and is an insult to farmers and the work they do,” he said.
“IFA will continue with our action until we have a substantial price increase. We don’t have to wait until ‘price setting Friday’, as ABP insisted in their press statement. This can happen any day. This sort of controlling practice only serves to fuel the belief amongst farmers that ABP are abusing their dominant position in the market. I would call on the other meat processors to break from this practice and announce a further price increase immediately, in line with increases in the market.” he said."

Beef farmers should not accept the current beef price on offer from the factories and demand a lot more according to the IFA President Joe Healy.
As part of their campaign for higher beef prices, the IFA this morning blockaded the Musgraves Central Distribution Centre (CDC) in Kilcock, Co Kildare.   The protest will last 12 hours and follows similar action at the Tesco central distribution centre in Dublin yesterday and the Aldi and Lidl CDCs last week.
Joe Healy said the latest Bord Bia Beef Price Index, (for Dec 1st), shows that the gap between Irish prices and our main export markets has widened again and now stands at 21c/kg, up from 20c/kg the previous week. This gap has increased from 5c/kg in mid-October to 21c/kg last week, highlighting the improvement in beef market prices to the factories.
“The facts are the factories held back on these market price improvements to farmers over the last five to six weeks and the Bord Bia Price Index proves this,” he said.
Joe Healy said steer prices at the factories have risen by 10c/kg this week and heifer prices are up 5c to 10c/kg depending on the factory. However, he said beef prices are still well behind the Bord Bia export benchmark price and even further behind the UK price. Irish farmers should be getting a higher price for their stock, supplies are tightening and farmers should hold out for more,” he said.
The latest EU Commission beef price data shows that cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have increased again for week ending Dec 1st to the equivalent of €4.13/kg, which is 52c/kg or €187 per head ahead of Irish prices. He said the UK price return has increased again with sterling improved to 84p/€.  “This level of a price gap is unsustainable and Irish cattle prices have to rise further, immediately.”
“We don’t have to wait for ‘price-setting Friday’ as stated by ABP. Factories should increase prices today and we are driving home the message to retailers. “Tell your suppliers to treat farmers fairly.” he said.
Mr. Healy said that farmers were also angry that SuperValu were promoting a ‘save 33%’ offer on Irish beef at the weekend. “This unsustainable discounting ends up being paid for by farmers,” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-elects-brendan-golden-as-new-national-livestock-chairman/,2020-01-08,IFA Elects Brendan Golden as New National Livestock Chairman,"Brendan Golden has been elected as the new Chairman of the IFA National Livestock Committee at a meeting in Portlaoise this week.
He will take over from outgoing Chairman Angus Woods at the Annual General Meeting on Monday, Jan 27th.
Brendan Golden is suckler beef farmer from Killala Co Mayo, finishing mainly steer and young bull beef. He also sells some finished cows and heifer weanlings. He farms 70 suckler cows on 80 ha of owned and rented land alongside his wife Ann and three sons.
Speaking after his election, Brendan Golden said the challenges in the beef and livestock sector are immense. He said never was it more important for Irish beef farmers to adopt the principles of Unity, Strength and Delivery to improve the income situation of farmers on the ground.
Brendan Golden’s key priorities for beef and livestock farmers include;
An immediate lift in cattle prices to restore viability and increase farm incomes
Restoring and maintaining strong direct payments in CAP 2020 and through Farm Schemes.
Protecting the beef sector against Brexit and other trade deals.
Defending EU production standards and grass-based systems on environmental, food safety and traceability grounds.
Maximising market access for beef and live exports.
Supporting and maintaining the national suckler cow herd.
Brendan Golden said the Minister for Agriculture and the EU Commissioner for Agriculture must be prepared to stand up and fearlessly defend the Irish and European beef farmer and the family farm model.
Brendan Golden and the National Livestock Committee thanked the outgoing Chairman Angus Woods for strong and honest leadership of beef farmers over the last four years at national and European level.
The election was conducted by the IFA National Returning officer Richard Kennedy."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/cattle-finishers-demand-more-on-beef-ifa/,2020-02-03,Cattle Finishers Demand More on Beef – IFA," IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said cattle prices are continuing to rise, but much too slowly for finishers, who need a substantial price lift at this stage.
He said supplies are much tighter and farmers need to dig in very hard, demanding more on price. “Farmers should reject the quoted prices and ask for at least 10c/kg more. Factory procurement managers are cold calling feeders trying to pin down supplies and cut deals.”
“It’s well known that many of the big processors don’t have as many cattle in feedlots as usual. They are trying to secure stock for the weeks ahead. With 55,000 fewer cattle in the system, based on AIMS data, supplies should get much tighter over the coming weeks.”
Brendan Golden said the base price for steers and heifers is continuing to creep upwards with steers making €3.60/3.65/kg and some top prices of €3.70 paid. Heifers are on €3.65 with €3.70/kg becoming more common.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said some flat price deals of €3.70/kg has been negotiated for Friesian steers.
Young bulls have also lifted a little with O grades making €3.40/kg, R grades €3.50/kg and up to €3.65/kg for U grades.
Cow price is ranging from €2.90/kg to €3.45/kg for top grade cows.
Brendan Golden said prices in our main export market in the UK continuing to rise with R3 grade steers up another 1p/kg for week ending Jan 25th to £3.40/kg, which is equivalent to €4.24/kg incl vat. He said the UK price is 42c/kg ahead of the Irish price.
The IFA Livestock leader said the average R3 price paid by Irish factories for w/e Jan 25th varied from €3.99/kg in Foyle Meats in Donegal to less than €3.75/kg in a number of plants. He said there is a variation of up to 29c/kg between the top and the bottom, clearly showing that farmers should shop around and that deals are being done way above the quoted base prices."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/factories-have-a-major-responsibility-to-steady-the-beef-market/,2020-03-26,Factories Have a Major Responsibility to Steady the Beef Market,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said farmers and factories need to work together to steady the beef trade at this critical time.
He said the major responsibility is with the factories not to pull prices and undermine the trade.  Farmers need to avoid moving any under finished cattle.
“With orderly marketing, cattle supplies are expected to tighten over the next number of weeks and this should help steady the trade.”
IFA has put a detailed set of proposals to Agriculture Minister Michael Creed to push for supports at EU level.   “IFA is demanding that all non-EU beef imports, especially South American beef imports, which fail to meet EU standards, should be suspended.”
The IFA has also requested the EU Commission to put the necessary funding in place to support farmers and keep the food supply chain operational.
Brendan Golden said IFA is working with the marts and the Department to ensure alternative and safe arrangements are put in place which would allow cattle to continue to move.
He said “While mart auctions have been closed, marts have weighing facilities and a system that provides security of payment, which are critical for farm-to-farm movements”.
The IFA Livestock leader said IFA has also being in contact with a number of the main banks emphasising the need for flexibility. IFA has made a number of proposals including that the banks would increase/extend working capital and overdraft facilities as well as lower cost loan products for farmers and allow for an interest and capital repayment break of up to six months."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-update-april-6th/,2020-04-07,Beef Update April 6th,"General Issues
At national level IFA has undertaken an intensive lobby of politicians focused on the need for immediate Government and EU action to address the market and income crisis on beef and lamb as a result of the COVID-19 Emergency.
IFA demands and action are based around the detailed IFA Submission to the EU Commission including market supports around an effective type of APS (Aids to Private Storage) and direct payment to farmers on price losses. IFA are also demanding action to address imports and more promotions at retail level.
Minister Creed and senior officials in the DAFM have been lobbied and fully briefed on the issues.
At European level through our Brussels office and COPA, the relevant EU Commissioners and Commission officials have all been made fully aware of the very difficult situation at farm level in Ireland. In addition, key players from other member states have been briefed with particular focus on the French, Polish and Italians on beef and the French on sheep.
IFA has been in contact with the major banks seeking flexibilities on all facilities including overdraft/stocking and term loans. It is important farmers make contact with their bank and apply for assistance.
Be aware of the IFA Plan B, to assist any farmer unable to farm. See ifa.ie/covid19.

IFA is in constant contact with the processors and MII to try and get some stability to the trade.
Extremely difficult to get Bulls and out od spec cattle moved. Significant restrictions on kill numbers emerging.
The latest cattle prices (w/e March 29th) across the main EU markets are now starting to show price reductions. Bord Bia web site.
There is always a lag factor between actual prices and reported prices.

In the week ending March 29th; EU Young bull prices were back 0.5c/kg, steers were down 1.67c/kg, cows were down 4.6c/kg and heifers back 3.8c/kg.
Extremely difficult beef market situation across the EU. While there is an increase in retail demand for mostly mince and diced beef this has not made up for the closure in the food service sector. The position is compounded in Ireland due to our strong export dependence.
IFA worked closely with the marts and the DAFM to get marts working again, be it in a very restrictive manner. Marts have to agree a SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) with their DVO to proceed.
17,220 cattle were exported live in the week commencing 16/3/2020, 16,599 mainly calves to EU (Except NI). Live exports for 2020 amount to 88,208 compared to 88,532 in 2019. While some calves are continuing to move, the loss of the restaurant and food service market has impacted hard on the veal trade in Holland. Purcell’s loaded a boat for Turkey last week.
Roundwood Livestock Ltd, a new live export company based in Wicklow, with Dr Ahmed Salman as the principle, has secured a Government contract to supply 12,000 bulls and steers to Algeria. Roundwood are currently purchasing for this.

IFA has requested SuperValu clarify its beef purchasing policy after labelling errors were highlighted. IFA also highlighted issues around the use of “produced in Ireland” logo and the absence of the Bord Bia QA logo, despite a clear commitment from SuperValue that all its fresh beef is Bord Bia Quality Assured and Irish.
IFA is demanding that 100% of the BPS and other direct payment schemes will be made in the early autumn. The DAFM has paused the majority of inspections for the next 2 weeks. The nitrates deadline extended to end of June.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-president-seeks-immediate-action-from-minister-creed-on-beef/,2020-04-10,IFA President Seeks Immediate Action from Minister Creed on Beef,"IFA President Tim Cullinan was joined by Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden and Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan in a conference call with the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed this week.
Speaking afterwards, the IFA President said Minister Creed needs to realise that beef finishers, who are a vital part of the sector, are battling a crisis that is not of their making.
“We need action from the Minister to release the unspent BEAM funding of €24m to the sector immediately. I have spoken to the Minister’s cabinet colleagues and they agree that beef finishers need urgent support,” Tim Cullinan said.
“The Minister confirmed to IFA that he would be putting forward a strong case to the EU for direct payments for beef farmers and for Private Storage Aid for the beef and dairy sectors. However, the next meeting of EU Council of Agriculture Ministers is not until April 27th. Beef farmers, in particular, cannot wait until then,” said the IFA President
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden told Minister Creed many farmers can’t get cattle killed, with factories saying they cannot take the stock. “On top of this, prices have collapsed by €100 per head in the last three weeks and are down €200 per head from break even.”
“There is no doubt but that the EU will need to respond to this crisis.  However, the Minister needs to act in the short term to support beef farmers” he said.
IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan told Minister Creed that the Aids to Private Storage were needed in the dairy sector to stabilise markets.
“Global dairy markets are under pressure: in the last week alone, Dutch spot butter prices have fallen €500/t to €2,700/t and SMP by €170/t to €1,850/t.  With the food service sector closed, there will be a need to store product until they’re open fully,” he said
IFA also raised the issue of the difficulties with the calf and store cattle trade due to the restrictions on the marts and the need for the €350 per week Government payment to include farmers who cannot trade."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-and-sheep-update-17th-july/,2020-07-17,Beef and Sheep Update 17th July,"Cattle Prices Rising
Cattle prices are continuing to rise driven by strong demand, tighter supplies, an abundance of grass and excellent thrive. Factories are paying from €3.70/kg to €3.80/kg base price, with deals on haulage, weight, conformation and fats.
Based on the strong prices in our main export market in the UK, which are the equivalent of €4.24/kg, factories can afford to increase prices further.
Supplies have tightened and AIMs data shows that there is a reduction of 93,000 in the number of forward cattle on farms compared to last year.
Lamb Prices Rising
Strong market driven demand for the EID Muslin festival and a reduction in New Zealand imports is driving the lamb price.
Factories are paying €5.65/kg to €5.75/kg with top prices incl bonuses of €5.90/kg paid over the last week. These prices are about 70c/kg ahead of last year.
UK lamb prices are also rising at £4.83/kg or the equivalent of €5.56/kg incl vat for w/e July 12th. These prices are 70p/kg ahead of last year.
EU Budget, CAP and MFF
EU heads of state, including the new Taoiseach Micheal Martin are in Brussels this weekend to try and negotiate agreement on the next MFF (Multi-lateral Financial Framework) for the EU for 2020-2027.
These negotiations are critical for the CAP Budget, EU Green Deal, Covid-19 EU Recovery Plan and Brexit contingency funding.
IFA has been campaigning for an increase in the overall CAP budget that would cover inflation and the extra asks on farmers. IFA has made it clear that there can be no cuts for farmer payments.
€50m Beef Finishers Pandemic Payment
IFA has made a detailed submission to the Department of Agriculture on the allocation of the €50m Beef Finishers Scheme, secured by the Association following an intensive lobby from April to June.
IFA is clear that the payment should be €100 per animal and targeted to beef finishers that incurred the highest losses in terms of price cuts/market disturbance and the highest feeding costs.
Changes to the Bord Bia Grass fed
Following further consultation with the IFA over recent weeks, Bord Bia has agreed to the following changes to the grass fed standard;
To adapt the scope of the grass fed standard to accommodate young bull beef. This change means young bull beef will now be eligible to be included in the grass fed standard, along with steers, heifers and cows.
To provide that the first nine months of an animal’s life (including young bulls) will be deemed as grass fed regardless of whether they were on QA (Quality Assured) or non-QA farm(s).
To treat young bulls the same as other animal categories with their qualification as grass fed being dependent on meeting the criteria of the standard concerning the proportion of grass in the diet and grazing days.
Lamb Imports.
IFA has written to the Minister for Agriculture about live lamb imports demanding that the Department of Agriculture publish the volumes and origin of all lamb imports on a weekly basis. IFA also met with DAFM senior officials on the issue.

He said the figures show winter finishers selling cattle have taken a battering on beef price in the order of €200 per head, when compared to the pre-Brexit and pre-COVID-19 prices.
“Without a direct payment to make up for these price losses, many winter finishers will not survive after this spring, which has been financially horrendous,” he said.
Over the nine-week period from March 16th to May 17th,. the figures show that the COVID-19 related losses were €21.22m, or about €2.5m per week.

EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen recently announced a COVID19 Recovery Package for Europe, including a Pandemic Crisis Fund of €540bn, a €1,100 bn MFF for next 7 years and a European Recovery Next Generation Fund of €750bn.
While the new proposal increases in CAP funding from original Commission proposal, it still involves a 9% decrease from EU CAP Budget 2014- 2020 at constant 2018 prices.
Included in the CAP is €15bn from the Next Generation Fund to support climate change initiatives in the Just Transition Programme to support rural areas to make structural changes necessary in line with the European Green Deal, Farm to Fork and the Biodiversity Strategies.
This funding is added to Pillar 2 funding and is available up to Dec 2024. It will be incorporated in Member States CAP Plans.
IFA has targeted that the value of Direct Payments post 2020 to be set at €2bn/yr. for next 7 years (€1.8bn/yr. currently).
The Commission proposals are to be discussed by EU Council Heads of State June 19th and agreement in July. Full package to be agreed by Q4 for implementation from Jan 2021.
If the Budget is agreed, EU CAP transition rules will mean various farm schemes will operate in 2021 under the “new money old rules” criteria. The details of the next CAP will not be finalised for 1 to 2 years.
This will impact on the Basic Payment Scheme as a reduced Budget will cut payments.
For schemes like GLAS, TAMS, ANC’s, BDGP and Sheep Welfare funding will be taken from the next programming period and will reduce the next plan to either 5 or 6 years depending on length of transition.
The main points in the New Green Deal Farm to Fork + Biodiversity Strategies include;
Reducing the use of chemical pesticides by 50% by 2030.
Reducing nutrient losses by 50% and the use of fertilisers by 20% by 2030.
Reducing the sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals by 50% by 2030.
Revising and improving animal welfare legislation based on scientific evidence.
Increasing Organic farming to 25% of EU land area by 2030.
Clarifying competition rules for collective initiatives to strengthen farmers position in the supply chain.
Developing a Green based model rewarding farmers for Carbon sequestration through CAP or market.

  “The latest R3 steer price for the UK for week ended June 27th is £3.67/kg, which is equivalent to €4.27/kg. This is 47c/kg above Irish prices and amounts to a price differential of €170 per head.”"

“Take your boot off the beef finisher, take the handbrake off the beef price and let prices rise in line with rising market returns”.
  The IFA President said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 40c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg.
  “The beef market in the UK, where we export most of our beef, is rising rapidly week on week while our prices are struggling to move on, as the factories keep the handbrake on the trade.”
  He said beef finishers have incurred massive beef price losses this spring, in the order of €200 per head. “It’s essential the Minister for Agriculture immediately opens applications and makes speedy payments under the new €50m Beef Finishers’ Scheme”.
  At the Taskforce meeting, Tim Cullinan questioned consultants Grant Thornton who were retained by the Minister to investigate the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, along the supply chain. He said the success or failure of this investigation will depend on the data from the factories and retailers.
  “The Minister for Agriculture needs to be strong and bluntly tell the beef factories and the retailers they must co-operate fully and provide all the required price and margin information for this important investigation.”
  The IFA President also raised issues on the Bord Bia Grass fed and PGI proposals around the lack of proper consultation with IFA and farmers and the need for more engagement. IFA has raised the exclusion of young bulls from eligibility for grass-fed and the confusion over excluding the first nine months of age as key issues.
  Tim Cullinan said farmers want to know how will the market benefits from grass-fed and PGI be passed back to farmers and if there will be a price premium.
  “Farmers want to know the details around the ownership of the grass-fed and PGI initiatives. Who will own and who control the brands?”.

Cattle Prices need to rise. IFA said this week farmers selling finished cattle should demand higher beef prices as all the market factors show the factories can pay more. Prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 44c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg. AHBD report that UK cattle prices continue to rise strongly up another 2.3p/kg for week ended June 20th.  The UK steer price is at £3.68/kg, equivalent to €4.29/kg incl vat.  This is 48c/kg above the Irish price, which amounts to a price differential of €173 on an average steer. Cattle price across the main EU markets are also recovering with retail sales continue to show very strong growth and food service coming back as the Covid restrictions are eased.  Factories agents and procurement managers are very active buying finished cattle in the marts and on line and paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices. In addition, Northern Ireland  factories are very active, paying prices from 10 to 20c/kg above Irish prices. The Northern Ireland LMC report that 785 cattle were exported live from the Republic to Northern Ireland for slaughter in the week to June 20 The R3 steer price in Northern Ireland was £3.61/kg, which is equivalent to €4.20/kg.  Department of Agriculture AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on May 1st there was a reduction of 83,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12-24-month category and 10,000 in the 24-36 month category compared to 2019, meaning that supplies over the next number of months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels. Retail consumption figures for Ireland continue to show very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks to May 17th., compared to 2019 levels. In the UK, retail data shows beef volume sales up 22.4% and value sales up 23.1%, for the 12-week period to May 17th compared to 2019, with stake sales up 24% and mince up 36%.
EU Meat Market Observatory. IFA participated in the EU Commission Meat Market Observatory meeting in Brussels this week, where the Commission said the beef market is recovering slowly from Covid and prices are rising in most member states. EU exports are down 8% for the Jan-Arp period but imports are down 22%. IFA highlighted the major inadequacies in beef market supports in the CAP policy for a crisis like Covid and the ongoing uncertainties from Brexit. In a discussion on Farm to Fork, IFA highlighted the importance of a profitable and sustainable beef sector for rural areas and communities, land use and integration with other sectors like dairy.
Beef Taskforce. IFA attended a Beef Taskforce meeting this week and called on the processors to increase prices in line with increased market returns. IFA pointed out cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 40c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg. IFA questioned consultants Grant Thornton on the investigation into the supply chain and insisted that the Minister must tell the beef factories and the retailers to co-operate fully and provide all the required price and margin information for this important investigation. IFA also raised issues on the Bord Bia Grass fed and PGI proposals around the lack of proper consultation with farmers and the need for more engagement.
Lamb Prices. Strong market demand for lamb with factories paying 20c to 30c above low quoted prices. UK lamb prices increased up 17.6p/kg lw in the week at £2.36/kg, which is equivalent to €5.84/kg incl vat.

Following an intensive campaign over recent weeks, IFA has secured funding of €50m for a new Beef Finishers Scheme in response to the COVID-19 and other market disturbances.
IFA welcomed the scheme, which was announced by the Minister for Agriculture on Friday June 12th.
Beef finishers have incurred significant beef price losses from COVID -19 and other market disturbances this spring resulting in severe economic impact on their farm enterprises and family farm income.
IFA has held a number of meetings with the Department of Agriculture on the support package and made a detailed submission on proposals for the scheme this week.
The IFA made a number of important points in respect of the scheme including;
The scheme must be for cattle finishers and payment targeted at finishers who incurred the most financial losses.
All finished cattle should be covered in the scheme including steers, heifers, young bulls and cows, with the exception of cows with conformation score P and fat score 1 and calves. The Minister has made it clear factory owned and dealer owned cattle will not be covered.
The payment rate must be a minimum of €100 per finished animal.
Payments should apply to finished animals retrospectively from the announcement date by the Minister in order to prevent factories using the support in an anticompetitive way to manipulate prices on cattle going forward.
There should be no restrictive limit on the number of eligible animals per farm which qualify.
The terms and conditions of the scheme must be simple and farmer friendly.
There can be no conditionality attached to the scheme.
The full funding of €50m must be utilised and paid out under the scheme. The terms and conditions must be structured a way to ensure the total funding amount of €50million is paid out to farmers and none of the funds are left unused.
The application process should be simple and opened for farmers to apply immediately.
Payment should be made to all eligible applicants on or before the end of August, so as to ease the severe financial difficulties on finishing farms and also assist the weanling and store cattle trade in the second half of the year.
The payment should apply to all finished cattle sold in the marts, provided those cattle were slaughtered within 30 days of purchase. The payment should go to the farmer who sold the animal regardless of who purchased the animals in the mart.
The payment should apply to finished cattle exported live to Northern Ireland.
The payment should apply to finished cattle exported live to international markets.
It should be structured in such a way under EU state aids approval under the COVID-19 Temporary State Aid Framework so as to ensure all cattle finishers that apply get paid on all eligible cattle.
The scheme should positively accommodate farm partnerships and not in any way discriminate against individual farmer members in partnerships.
IFA is available for further consultation with the Department of Agriculture on the scheme.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-welcomes-government-package-for-beef-farmers/,2020-07-20,IFA Welcomes Government Package for Beef Farmers,"IFA President Tim Cullinan has welcomed the announcement by the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Agriculture Minister Michael Creed of a €50m direct payment package for beef farmers to cover price losses incurred as a result of the collapse in the market due to COVID-19 and other factors, including Brexit.
Tim Cullinan said, “The details of the scheme and the small print will be very important. IFA is set to meet with the Department of Agriculture next Monday to progress the scheme details further”.
“IFA made detailed submissions to Government outlining the strong case for a direct payment support package and our officers around the country have worked hard lobbying politicians,” he said.
“This new package, along with the recent €35m BEEP-S scheme secured for suckler cows is badly needed.”
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden also welcomed the beef package, saying finishers had taken a severe financial hit this spring. He said the COVID-19 crisis has impacted significantly on markets, especially the food service sector, which was closed down.
“As a major beef exporter, Ireland was hit much harder than many other countries.”
He said the figures show winter finishers selling cattle have taken a beef price battering in the order of €200 per head, when compared to pre-Brexit and pre-COVID-19 prices.
Brendan Golden said IFA campaigned hard on this all spring and it was good to see a positive outcome.
“Without a direct payment package to make up, in some part, for these price losses, many winter finishers will not survive after this spring, which has been financially horrendous,” he said."

The resumption of some manufacturing plants and some reopening of food service at EU level has helped the trade. The reopening of McDonalds and Supermacs drive-through helped the cow trade.
APS. Irish processors applied for only 20 tonnes of APS. Total applications across the EU of 706 tonnes with 400t from Poland, 230t from Holland, 46t from Spain and 10t from Austria.
Live Exports. 4,648 cattle were exported in the week commencing 04/5/2020, 3,822 to EU (Except NI). Live exports for 2020 amount to 144,977 compared to 186,276 in 2019.
Calf exports of 112,383 year to date.
There were considerable difficulties with the Algerian live export trade over recent weeks, involving loading delays, payment difficulties and delays on the first shipment. IFA assisted up to about 15 farmers getting paid in full.
When the boat, the MV Sarah returned for the second shipment, difficulties occurred between the exporter and the DAFM on horned cattle, individual weighing and withdrawal periods on medications.
Working with the exporter and the DAFM, IFA asked Minister Creed to intervene directly, which he did and all of these issues were subsequently resolved but shipments were delayed and along with TB difficulties on some farms the exporter was unable to proceed and cancelled the shipment. The livestock carrier has left Ireland empty.
IFA Payment Policy. Insist on payment on the day, or ensure that you are selling through an outlet where payment is guaranteed or secure.

IFA has called for the marts to be reopened as soon as possible. IFA also pushing for support for the marts.
BEEP-S. Just over 27,000 farmers applied for the BEEP-S scheme, following an intensive campaign by IFA. It is estimated that some c600,000 cows are involved, which will require funding of c€52m as opposed to the €35m allocated, if a linear cut to the payment rates of €90 per cow on the first 10 and €80 on the remainder are to be avoided.
Support for Beef Farmers. Finishers Income. Finishers are still shipping serious losses. IFA will continue to push Minister Creed, the Government and the EU Commission hard to secure a direct payment for finishers to cover the COVID-19 and Brexit losses on cattle sold this year.
At the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels Minister Creed sought exceptional aid for livestock producers under Articles 219 & 221 of CMO due to serious falls in prices. However, IFA is strongly of the view Minister Creed and the EU Commission must secure new money to deal with the COVID crisis.
IFA continue to lobby TDs and push Minister Creed and Government for a direct payment scheme to make up for the COVID and Brexit related cattle price losses incurred this Spring, including release of the €24m in unspent BEAM funding to assist beef finishers, who have incurred losses in the order of €200 per head.
Bord Bia Grass Based Beef and PGI status.
Bord Bia has prepared proposals for an Irish Grass Fed Beef and PGI status application.
In summary the proposals cover animals who meet the following key criteria;
The majority of feed from grass (90% grass or grass forage throughout the animal’s lifetime)
Spend greater part of their life grazing (minimum of 220 days per year).
Steers/heifers up to 36 months of age, Grade O- or better and fat score 2+ to 4+.
Beef cows up to 120 months with conformation of O+ or better and fat score 2+ to 5.
Born, reared, finished and slaughtered in the geographical area.
Budget 2021 Proposals
2019 Brexit Beef Price Losses
In line with the methodology used to calculate BEAM 1, IFA has calculated Brexit related cattle prices losses for beef farmers who sold cattle between May 2019 (when BEAM 1 ended) and December 31 2019.
These calculations compared 2015 cattle prices(pre-Brexit) with 2019 prices.
2019 – Brexit related price losses from May 12th to Dec 31st 2019 (BEAM II) = €160m.
2020 Brexit and COVID-19 Beef Price Losses
Since January 2020 finisher have continued to encounter Brexit related cattle price losses. However, from mid-March finishers were hit with a second wave of COVID-19 market disturbance beef price losses, which compounded their overall losses. Using the same methodology IFA has calculated the Brexit related and COVID-19 related beef price losses as follow from Jan 1st 2020 to May 17th 2020 as follows.
Brexit related price losses: €89.8m
COVID-19 related price losses: €21.2m
Overall Brexit/COVID-19 losses:€111m up to May 17th 2020.
2020 – Brexit and COVID-19 related beef price losses from Jan 1 to May 17. 2020= €111m.
Support for Suckers
The national suckler cow herd of almost 1 million cows is the backbone of Ireland’s beef and livestock sector worth up to €3bn, providing top quality beef to make Ireland the fifth largest beef exporter in the world. The suckler beef sector also delivers essential socio-economic and environmental services and public goods, as well as providing a major carbon sink.
The support schemes for the suckler cow (BDGP and BEEP) have proven to be essential in terms of economic support and in improving efficiencies on environmental performance and delivery.
IFA proposes:
Suckler farmers need a targeted payment of €300 per cow, facilitated by a combination of CAP and national funding.
For 2020, a total of 27,000 suckler farmers have applied for the BEEP-S scheme, with up to 600,000 cows. At the payment rates of €90 on the first 10 cows and €80 on the remainder, the funding costs of this scheme will be €52m in 2020, as opposed to the €35m allocated in Oct 2019. Therefore, this scheme will need a budget injection of an additional €17m for 2020
The last annual payment under the current BDGP scheme is due in Nov/Dec 2020 and the BEEP-S scheme is an annual scheme.
For 2021, the IFA is proposing the BDGP is renewed and simplified with funding increased from €45m to €90m pa and the BEEP-S scheme is funded to the tune of €52m pa.
This would provide total funding of €142m pa for sucklers and enable payment rates of €290 per cow on the first 10 cows and €250 per cow on the remainder.
  BovINE Project.
IFA is involved with Teagasc, farm organisations and research and advisory bodies across 10 EU member states in an EU funded Innovation network project focused on facilitating improved knowledge exchange and co-ordinated solutions on socio-economic resilience, animal health and welfare, production efficiency and quality and environmentally sustainability.

Supplies are expected to rise quickly as the new season lambs becomes fit and ready for sale. The advice is as always – move lambs as they become fit.
COVID-19 and Numbers. Major concern about prices when new season lamb numbers rise and the market impact from the COVID-19 crisis is fully felt. The closure of the foodservice sector across the EU is a major blow to the markets.
Lamb is a high value product and needs high value outlets such as restaurants.
In the UK for week ending May 10th hogget’s were £4.71/kg equivalent to €5.58/kg. New season lambs were on £5.14/kg, equivalent to €6.09/kg incl vat.
APS – no uptake to date at EU level. The restrictions limiting access to carcases and half carcases as opposed to cuts is an issue which IFA highlighted to the DAFM and Commission. APS may be needed as supply numbers increase and depending on the recovery in the food service markets.

New Zealand lamb exports have been hit hard by COVID-19, with EU exports for the month of April down 28% and exports year to date back 47%, mainly due to the closure of the food services sector.
IFA will continue to publish lamb prices twice weekly and all of the latest data is on ifa.ie
In conjunction with COPA at EU level, the IFA has lobbied for the following measures for the sheep sector. Immediately support farmers with direct payments for any price related market losses, APS for market support, review and suspend non-EU imports during the COVID-19 crisis, a new EU promotional programme for lamb targeted at retail level.
Budget 2021 Proposal. With 34,000 flock owners, sheep farming is the second largest sector in terms of farm numbers. The sector has an output of €450m with exports of 55,000t to 35 different countries.
The Sheep Welfare Scheme has been very positive and effective; sheep are major contributors to environmental preservation, particularly in hill and mountainous areas. The four-year scheme is due to conclude in Dec 2020.
IFA Proposal; A targeted payment of €30 per ewe through a combination of CAP and national funding for sheep farmers. Across the national flock of 2.57 million ewes, this would require funding of €77m pa.
Government Formation. €30 per ewe. IFA are lobbying for a targeted direct payment of €30 per ewe to be included in the Programme for Government as committed to by the political parties during the election campaign.
EU/NZ Trade Talks. The seventh round of EU negotiations with New Zealand on a new trade deal took place between March 30th and April 9th. EU are now discussing a 3,000t beef TRQ at 7.5% tariff and a safeguard clause on lamb.

“While the food service sector remains a major problem, there needs to be a better return to the farmer from the strong increase in retail sales. Cattle prices are up 10c/15c/kg in the last two weeks, but returns are still loss-making for finishers.”
  Brendan Golden said Kantar figures for the Irish market in the last four weeks to April 19th compared to the same period in 2019, volume beef sales are up 14.9%, with mince sales up 26.1% and steak sales up 15.2%. In value terms, sales are up 15.2%.
  In the UK, our main export market, retail sales for the 12 weeks to April 19th show beef volumes up 16.2% and spend up 15.3%. Mince sales are reported up 27% and steak sales are up 10.8%.
Cattle prices in the UK are also rising with the AHDB reporting ‘In the week ended May 2nd, prime cattle prices up by 1.5p/kg. Steer prices led the way with prices overall increasing by 1.6p, to 324.4p/kg, carcases meeting the R3 and R4L specs rose in price by 2.4p and 1.8p respectively. Heifer prices posted a more modest gain of 1.0p, to average 324.0p/kg overall’.
“R3 steers were up 2.4p/kg to £3.30/kg, equivalent to €3.95/kg incl vat at 5.4%. O4L cows were up 8p/kg to £2.39/kg equivalent to €2.86/kg”.
The AHDB also said “Young bulls rose in price by over 3p overall, to 314.5p/kg. Cow prices too gained a substantial 5.7p to 216.0p/kg. Those meeting the –O4L spec gained more than 8p to average nearly 238.9p/kg, likely underpinned by the continued strength in demand for minced beef at retail”."

Supplies totalled 25,947 for week ending May 10th, down about 3,750 on the same week last year. Kill to date down 26,000 or 4% on 2019 levels.
Cattle prices continue to strengthen driven by tighter supplies and strong retail demand. Procurement managers and agents chasing stock, offering deals which include the full cost of transport, removal of weight restrictions and additional price top ups. The supply balance has swung in favour of the farmer and feeders should dig in hard and negotiate a strong premium above the quoted base price as well as transport and other specifications.

The continuing rise in cattle prices is more positive. Base prices are now at €3.50/3.60 for steers and €3.55/3.70 for heifers. Supplies are very tight.
Minister Creed sought exceptional aid for livestock producers under Articles 219 & 221 of CMO due to serious falls in prices at the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels this week. However, Minister Creed and the EU Commission must secure new money to deal with the COVID crisis.
IFA continue to lobby TDs and push Minister Creed and Government for a direct payment scheme to make up for the COVID and Brexit related cattle price losses incurred this Spring, including release of the €24m in unspent BEAM funding to assist beef finishers, who have incurred losses in the order of €200 per head.
Irish processors applied for only 20 tonnes of APS. Total applications across the EU of 706 tonnes with 400t from Poland, 230t from Holland, 46t from Spain and 10t from Austria.
Positive news that some McDonalds drive through restaurants will reopen next week.
As of Friday morning, over 25,000 suckler farmers had applied for the BEEP-S scheme, which is worth €80/90 per suckler cow.
IFA has called for the marts to be reopened as soon as possible. IFA also pushing for support for the marts.
On live exports, there are some positive signs that the problems relating to the Sarah M livestock boat are being resolved and a sailing is being planned again for next week. Earlier this week IFA called on Minister Creed to intervene and resolve the issues between the Department and the exporter on the Algerian trade.
Security of payment is vital for farmers selling cattle. IFA policy to insist on payment on the day, or ensure that you are selling through an outlet where payment is guaranteed or secure. Sell through a local licensed mart where you know your payment is secure, or insist on payment upfront on the day is the best approach.
National Livestock Committee meeting was held week by conference call. Key issues included cattle prices, direct aid for finishers, Government formation and lobbying of TDs, Live exports, Bord Bia, Marts and AOB.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/some-positive-signs-on-beef-but-minister-must-address-financial-crisis-on-farms/,2020-07-20,"Some Positive Signs on Beef, but Minister Must Address Financial Crisis on Farms","IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said there are some small positive signs on the cattle price side, with some factories paying a base of €3.45/kg for steers and €3.50/kg for heifers this week as the numbers of in-spec finished cattle continue to tighten.
Some factories have broken the €3.40/kg base price barrier to get stock. As was expected based on the AIMs data, the number of in-spec finished cattle has tightened and will continue to get tighter over the coming weeks.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said cow prices are also rising with good R grade cows up 15/20c/kg over the last week to 10 days, reflecting increased market demand for manufacturing beef based on higher retail sales and as some burger and manufacturing plants plan to re-open.
With major increases in retail sales, Brendan Golden called on supermarkets to pass back some of the higher revenues from consumers back down the chain to hard-pressed farmer finishers.
“Agriculture Minister Michael Creed can no longer ignore the financial calamity that has played out on beef finishing farms before and since the COVID-19 crisis,” he said.
Prior to COVID-19, beef prices were extremely poor due mainly to Brexit uncertainty and exchange rate problems and farmers selling cattle were facing losses in the order of €100 per head. Since then, beef prices have fallen from a base of €3.65/kg to €3.40/kg and inflicted another €100 per head in price losses.
The IFA livestock leader said Minister Creed must add to the unspent BEAM funding and immediately put in place a direct payment scheme to help make up for the price losses on finishing farms this spring.
Regarding the APS scheme announced by the EU Commission, Brendan Golden said IFA has lobbied hard in Brussels to get market support and has also lobbied this week to have the scheme extended to cover O grade animals and boneless cuts. He said the factories have to respond and this must be reflected in some benefits in terms of improved prices back to farmers.
He said the EU Commission will have to introduce an emergency EU financial aid package for those Member States where COVID-19 problems have resulted in significant market and price losses.
The Commission has all the data on the price and income losses pre and post COVID-19 and is in a position to target direct income support to the farmers in the Member States that have been affected the most.
He said “Family farmers selling 50 cattle are facing losses of €10,000. They simply cannot afford this level of loss, especially having come through two very difficult years in 2018 and 2019”."

Extremely difficult beef market situation across the EU, with cattle prices continuing to ease back. With restaurants other food service and manufacturing outlets closed demand remains very subdued. Real difficulties for steaks and cow beef.
While there is an increase in retail demand for mostly mince and diced beef this has not made up for the closure in the food service sector. The position is compounded in Ireland due to our strong export dependence.
Some positives in the market with Supermacs reopening some drive-ins and also better reports from some EU markets.

General Issues
Following intensive lobbying by IFA at National and EU level, the EU Agriculture Commissioner announced a €80m package of market measures, mainly Aids to Private Storage (APS) for beef, sheep and dairy in Brussels this week.
On beef, the APS is for €25m covering 25,000t of forequarter beef.
The draft Commission regulation specifies APS for separated hindquarters bone in. It also specifies grades of S, E, U and Rs with aid of €1,008/t for 90 days storage, €1,033/t for 120 days and €1,058/t for 150 days.
IFA has told the DAFM and EU Commission there needs to be more flexibility and that O grades must be included, boneless cuts must be covered and the rate need to be increased.
For sheep, the APS is for 36,000t, worth €20m.
On sheep, the draft regulation specifies fresh or chilled carcasses of lamb aged less than 12 months of age, with aid per tonne of €866 for 90 days, €890 for 120 days and €915 for 150 days.
Again, IFA has made it clear to the DAFM and the Commission there needs to be flexibility, the age needs to increase, specific cuts such as legs etc must be included and the rate per tonne needs to increase.
IFA is continuing to lobby hard at National and EU level for a much greater and more comprehensive package of measures to address the market and income crisis on beef result of the COVID-19 Emergency.
IFA demands and action are based on market supports around an effective type of APS (Aids to Private Storage) and direct payment to farmers on price losses. IFA are also demanding action to suspend non-EU beef imports.
At National level IFA are requesting Minister Creed to immediately make available the c€24m in unspent BEAM funds to farmers selling finished cattle at a major loss.
This week IFA met (conference call) with Bord Bia on progressing Irelands application for PGI status for Irish Grass Fed Beef.
IFA also met Bord Bia on the introduction of remote assessments for Quality Assurance Audits/inspections. This will allow farmers remain quality assured and complete audits/inspection remotely, using mobile phones and the internet and without the necessity of a farm visit.
IFA secured clarification regarding farmers eligibility for the weekly COVID-19 payment of €350 per week.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-campaign-on-beef-price-supports-and-direct-income-aid/,2020-07-20,IFA Campaign on Beef Price Supports and Direct Income Aid,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said IFA is driving an intensive lobbying campaign with TDs and MEPs to get the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski to take urgent action to address the collapse in beef prices as a result of the COVID-19 emergency and the income crisis on livestock farms.

Brendan Golden said Minister Creed and Commissioner Wojciechowski cannot continue to ignore the beef crisis in Ireland. IFA has put forward specific proposals for APS (Aids to Private Storage) market support and direct payment support for beef farmers.
At national level, IFA has called on Minister Creed to immediately mobilise and make available to beef farmers the unspent €24m from BEAM funds in the form of a direct payment to farmers selling cattle, pending a more comprehensive EU package. “The Minister can do this immediately. The EU Commission has specifically instructed Member States to re-allocate unused funds.”
IFA is also demanding that the EU should suspend non-EU beef imports, which amounted to 318,500t in 2019. “Up to 80% of these imports are coming from Mercosur countries like Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay and are made up of steak cuts destined for the EU food service market. These outlets are closed because of COVID-19 restrictions and non-EU imports should be suspended.”
“Beef farmers are incurring major income losses with prices down 25c to 30c/kg in the last three to four weeks, well over €100/animal. Prices are back 40c/kg or €150 per head on 2015 (pre-Brexit) levels”.
The Irish beef sector is export oriented, with a very small domestic market. 30% of the value of carcases is made up of steak cuts and 60% of Irish steaks are sold to the food service sector. The closure of these outlets due to COVID19 is extremely damaging and disproportionately affecting Irish beef prices and farm incomes."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/factories-have-to-stop-driving-farmers-out-of-business/,2020-07-20,Factories Have to Stop Driving Farmers out of Business,"IFA President Tim Cullinan said factories have to stop driving farmers out of business and give an immediate beef price increase.
“The market has clearly improved, yet factories continue to try and hold back the price. IFA has outlined 10 reasons why cattle prices should rise. The factories need to increase prices immediately,” he said.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said that all of the market facts point to a rising market. He said it is very clear the factories can pay more.
“We have been in contact with some of the main processors this week and we made it very clear to them that they can’t hold back on a price increase any longer.”
 10 Reasons why cattle prices should rise:
Prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 44c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg.
AHBD report that UK steer price is at £3.68/kg, equivalent to €4.29/kg incl vat. and continuing to rise, up another 2.3p/kg for the latest reported week ended June 20th.  This is 48c/kg above the Irish price, which amounts to a price differential of €173 on an average steer.
Cattle price across the main EU markets are also recovering with retail sales continuing to show very strong growth and food service coming back as the COVID-19 restrictions are eased.
The Bord Bia prime export benchmark price has moved ahead of the Irish price over the last two weeks, showing the improvement in market returns.
Factories agents and procurement managers are very active, buying finished cattle in the marts and online, paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices.
Northern Ireland factories are very active in the South, paying prices from 10 to 20c/kg above Irish prices.
The R3 steer price in Northern Ireland was £3.61/kg, which is equivalent to €4.20/kg.
The Northern Ireland LMC report that 785 cattle were exported live from the Republic to Northern Ireland for slaughter in the week to June 20.
Department of Agriculture AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on May 1st there was a reduction of 83,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12-24-month category and 10,000 in the 24-36 month category compared to 2019, meaning that supplies over the next number of months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels.
Retail consumption figures for Ireland continue to show very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks to May 17th., compared to 2019 levels. In the UK, retail data shows beef volume sales up 22.4% and value sales up 23.1%, for the 12-week period to May 17th compared to 2019, with stake sales up 24% and mince up 36%."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/stronger-beef-markets-means-theres-no-basis-for-price-pressure/,2020-07-20,Stronger Beef Markets Means There’s No Basis for Price Pressure,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said there was no basis for pressure on cattle prices from the factories. “Prices are rising strongly in our main export market in the UK and also across EU markets and the food service sector is coming back as the economy reopens,” he said.
Brendan Golden said there was no basis for factories to try to lower quoted beef prices as all of the market facts were pointing in the opposite more positive direction.
Beef prices in the UK, our major export market, has increased by 15p/kg in the last two weeks to May 30th, with steer prices now reported at £3.51/kg, which is equivalent to €4.16/kg incl vat. This is some 35c/kg (€126 per head) over R3 Irish prices at €3.81/kg for the same week.
EU prime cattle prices have also risen strongly in the last two weeks with young bull prices up 7c/kg and heifer prices up 6c/kg to May 31st.
The latest DAFM AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on April 1st there was a reduction of 103,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12 to 24-month category, meaning that supplies over the next number of weeks and months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels.
The latest retail consumption figures for Ireland from Kanter show continued and very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks, compared to 2019 levels. In the UK, AHDB retail data shows beef volume sales up 17.7% and value sales up 19.4%, compared to 2019.
Cow prices in the UK have risen rapidly over the last three weeks to May 31st., up 26p/kg with O+3 grade cows making £2.79/kg, equivalent to €3.30/kg incl vat and reflecting the extremely strong manufacturing demand and burger trade.
  Brendan Golden said some factories are incorrectly using the excuse of the temporary closure of China as a means for price pressure. However, the Minister and Department of Agriculture has made it clear that this is only a technicality and the market will re-open soon.
  The IFA National Livestock Leader said farmers should dig in hard with the meat plants and insist on more than the quoted price.  This is well justified by the stronger market returns over the last number of weeks."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-should-demand-more-on-beef-as-the-market-can-pay-more/,2020-07-20,Farmers Should Demand More on Beef as the Market Can Pay More,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said farmers selling finished cattle should demand higher beef prices as all the market factors show the factories can pay more.
Brendan Golden said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 40c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg.
  “The beef market in the UK, where we export most of our beef, is rising rapidly week on week while our prices are struggling to move on.”
  AHBD report that UK cattle prices continue to rise strongly up another 5.5p/kg for week ended June 13th.  The UK steer price is at £3.65/kg, equivalent to €4.27/kg incl vat.  This is 46c/kg above the Irish price, which amounts to €165 on an average steer.
  Brendan Golden also pointed out that cattle price across the main EU markets are also recovering with retail sales continue to show very strong growth and food service coming back as the COVID-19 restrictions are eased.
  “Factories agents and procurement managers are very active buying finished cattle in the marts and online, and paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices. In addition, Northern factories are very active, paying prices from 10 to 20c/kg above Irish prices.”
  The Northern Ireland LMC report that 791 cattle were exported live from the Republic to Northern Ireland for slaughter in the week to June 13th and the R3 steer price in Northern Ireland was £3.59, which is equivalent to €4.18/kg.
  The IFA Livestock leader pointed out that the Department of Agriculture AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on April 1st there was a reduction of 103,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12-24 month category, meaning that supplies over the next number of months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels.
  Retail consumption figures for Ireland continue to show very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks, compared to 2019 levels.
  In the UK, retail data shows beef volume sales up 22.4% and value sales up 23.1%, for the 12-week period to May 17th compared to 2019.
  Brendan Golden said figures produced by retail representatives at the EU Meat Market Observatory meeting attended by IFA in Brussels earlier this week show similar positive retail consumption trends across the main EU markets."

As well as a recovery package for the EU in response to the Covid-19 crisis, this plan also agreed the CAP Budget and a Brexit Adjustment Reserve of €5bn. The overall value of the Package was €1.8 trillion.
The final outcome is slightly better than the original Commission proposals At constant prices (adjusted for inflation) the CAP Budget was reduced from €382.8bn in 2014/2020 period to €243.9bn in 2021/2027 period, a reduction of 10.1%. In current prices (excluding inflation) the CAP Budget was maintained or slightly increased.
While the detailed breakdown of the CAP Budget figures for each individual country have yet to be provided by the Commission, the Taoiseach outlined to the Dail that the CAP Budget for Ireland had increased by €50m from €10.68bn (2014-2020) to €10.73bn (2021-2027) at current prices. However, Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary has indicated that the reduced budget will lead to a 3% reduction in BPS (Basic payment Scheme) payments from 2021 onwards.
Member states have the opportunity of increasing the level of National co-financing under CAP Pillar II measures. The level of co-financing is a national decision and has been set at a standard 43% EU and 57% national funding. This is a major change compared to the last CAP programming period, when in Irelands case the level of co-financing was 54% EU and 46% national.
If the Irish Government co-finance at the national rate of 57%, it could leave a 7-year RDP worth €5.241bn (2021-2027) compared to €4.1bn in the last period (2014-2020).
The debate will now move quickly to the level of National co-financing the Irish Government is prepared to provide, which will be critical in terms of financing future farm schemes and farm incomes.
IFA has set a target that Direct Payments (both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2), should increase from the current annual level of €1.8bn to €2bn in the next CAP post 2020.
IFA Budget 2021 Proposals
IFA has finalised its proposals to Government for Budget 2021, which will be in early October.
The specific proposals for Livestock and Sheep Farmers include the following;
Suckler Cows – targeted support of €300 per cow.
Additional €17m funding for BEEP-S for 2020 and future years
Increase in funding for BDGP from €45m to €90m.
Payment of €290 on the first 10 cows and €250 on the remainder for 2021.
Sheep Welfare – targeted payment of €30 per ewe from EU and national funding.
Brexit and Covid-19 Compensation for beef price losses.
Full compensation for all losses including €160m beef price losses from may 12th until Dec 31 2019 and €113m (€163-€50m Beef pandemic payment) losses from Jan 1st until July 5th On going losses of €6m per week.
€232m funding for Environmental schemes including reopening GLAS for the 2-year CAP transition.
Increase of €50m funding to bring ANC payments to €300m.
Increased funding for Climate change measures, Organic farming, KT schemes, Producer organisations, TAMs, Walk schemes, Farm Assist and Animal health measures.
A range of progressive taxation proposals.
€50m Beef Finishers Pandemic Payment
IFA has made a detailed submission to the Department of Agriculture on the allocation of the €50m Beef Finishers Scheme, secured by the Association following an intensive lobby from April to June.
IFA is clear that the payment should be €100 per animal and targeted to beef finishers that incurred the highest losses in terms of price cuts/market disturbance and the highest feeding costs.
The President met with the new Minister for Agriculture Dara Calleary this week and reiterated the IFA position along with discussing key issues on CAP, Brexit, Climate, Food Ombudsman and more. IFA also lobbied Government TDs on the issue this week.

Bord Bia Sustainable Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme Auditing
On the 18th of March 2020, Bord Bia postponed all audits across all schemes on advice of the Department of health and the HSE.
This was followed by remote auditing to continue to ensure the continued safety of all members and auditors.
Bord Bia are currently in the process of providing all necessary training and PPE to all auditors for the return to onsite auditing.
Auditors will use the Government COVID Tracker App on the day of each audit to confirm that they are not experiencing any Covid-19 symptoms before arriving on farms.
All auditors must also have an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) with them for the audit.
Looking forward farmers that are member of the Sustainable Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme will have two options in terms of auditing:
Remote auditing which, if successful, will result in a certificate period of 12-months.
2. Full on-site audit which, if successful, will result in a full 18-month certificate.
Bord Bia intend to start scheduling these audits from Monday 10th of August.
Important to note that all auditors will follow the strict government guidelines with regards to physical distancing and all other advised procedures.

“While it is clear that we need quicker COVID test results, to link this with prices to farmers is unacceptable,” he said.
“This is typical of the factories. They will use any excuse to cut prices to farmers,” he said.
“Public Health has to be the priority at all times, but farmers have been working around the clock to keep the food supply chain open. They are already struggling to make ends meet and this threat by MII at yesterday’s Oireachtas Committee hearing is unacceptable,” he said
“It’s important that we keep the supply chain open, but it cannot be done by passing costs back to farmers. The beef barons will have to take less profits in 2020, rather than playing workers off against farmers,” he said."

GLAS
GLAS is set to finish up at the end of 2020, which will affect 36,000 farmers. The IFA are urging Minister Dara Calleary to commence the process of extending the scheme as Brexit has delayed new schemes being introduced under the new CAP.
For farmers to continue receiving payments, the current Green Low-carbon Agri-environmental Scheme will need to be extended.
The IFA have told the DAFM that farmers want GLAS to be extended and transposed using a simple system and that it is important for this process to begin now to avoid a rushed process later in the year.
Staying Safe in Marts
The reopening of marts will positively effect the rural Irish economy and is incredibly important to the free trade of livestock. Having said that, it is important to do everything we can to minimise the spread of Covid-19.
The IFA are encouraging farmers to follow all Government guidelines to stay safe while trading in the mart. This includes practicing physical distancing, hand hygiene and wearing a mask in marts across the country.
Farmers in Laois, Kildare and Offaly must wear face masks in the mart since last weeks midlands restrictions were introduced."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-farmers-should-bargain-hard-for-the-strongest-price/,2020-08-20,Beef Farmers Should Bargain Hard for the Strongest Price,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has advised farmers to bargain hard when selling cattle.
“The market is strong and demand is good, with agents actively seeking animals. €3.65/€3.70 is being paid out and farmers should continue to fight hard for price,” he said.
Brendan Golden said UK prices have increased slightly this week and there is good demand in both Northern Ireland and the UK.
Trade in marts is very positive and weanling sales are off to a good start.
The Livestock Chairman also reminded farmers who qualify for the Beef Finisher Payment scheme to apply.
“We want the €50m out to farmers as quickly as possible. The closing date is Sept 9th and I would encourage farmers to get their applications in promptly. All the details are available at ifalegacystagi.wpengine.com/beef-finisher-scheme,” he said."

Reminder: BDGP Deadline Is Approaching
For those involved in the BDGP, ICBF have sent out a report informing you of your current compliance level with the programme. Those currently borderline compliant (0-2 animals above requirement) should consider obtaining some ‘buffer’ eligible animals in case of an unexpected animal death.  Those who are currently non-compliant (herds short of 50% target) should review their options.
ICBF have created a live ‘Mart Tracker’ which allows you to see what BDGP heifers (genotyped and 4/5 stars) are being traded in marts across the country on the same day. ICBF are also currently working on a ‘Farm to Farm’ element of the app to help farmers identify eligible heifers. Keep an eye out for dates of special sales in local marts which are being arranged by ICBF.

Storm Ellen Damage?
Check your policy: What you’ll be covered for will depend largely on what options you have included under your policy.
Safety: Farmers can make emergency repairs to their buildings, but should take great care to avoid injury. If there are emergency repairs to be made farmers should get a contractor to do it.
Repairs: Before any work is carried out you need to take photographs and keep any damaged materials so that your insurer can inspect them afterwards but absolutely make necessary emergency repairs. You can use a contractor of your choosing but it is important to make sure that they are insured and if you are unsure then contact your insurer who can check.
Dairy Equipment cover: If damage has been done dairy equipment over the past week, it is worth checking our policy to see if the repairs are covered.
Losses: Depending on your policy, certain cover exists for livestock. Storm cover is available for livestock, flood cover and electrocution cover is also available.

IFA are encouraging farmers to follow all Government guidelines to stay safe while trading in the mart.
This includes practicing physical distancing, hand hygiene and wearing a mask in marts across the country.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/market-conditions-justify-increase-in-beef-price/,2020-10-15,Market Conditions Justify Increase in Beef Price,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said factories here must reflect the strong market conditions in the UK for beef.
He said over the past two weeks, prices in the UK have stabilised and started to rise in response to the demand for beef in our main export market.
Currently the equivalent vat inclusive price for R3 steers in the UK is €4.34/kg, which is 53c/kg above the €3.81/kg paid for the same grade here. This is a differential of €190 in a 360 kg carcase.
Brendan Golden said cattle supplies for the remainder of the year are predicted to be tight. Slaughterings to-date are up 47,651 head in total compared to this time last year.
“The predicted kill for 2020 is similar to last year, leaving 50,000 fewer cattle to be killed between now and year end, compared to 2019,” he said.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said beef sales have performed well in the UK over the summer months and demand should strengthen further as buying for the Christmas trade starts.
He said significant price increases are justified based on the current market conditions and supplies of cattle that will be available and factories must reflect this in prices paid to farmers."

€6m in funding has been committed over the next three years to develop a suckler-based brand under the control of a farmer board.
The importance of building on the existing schemes to support suckler production and underpin the development of the brand was acknowledged by the Minister and the Taskforce.
Brendan Golden said, “This is a good outcome. The PGI will give us a chance to promote the world-renowned qualities of Irish beef while working on a brand for beef from suckler farms that promotes the quality, environmental and socio-economic benefits of this production system”.

Latest Beef price update 21/5/2020. Steer base price €3.60/kg. Heifers €3.60/3.70. Young bull’s R/O €3.60/3.70. Cows P/O/R/U €2.90/€3.00/€3.20/kg.
This time last year prices were running 25/30c/kg higher.
Cattle prices continue to strengthen driven by tighter supplies and strong retail demand. Factories chasing tight supplies, offering deals which include the full cost of transport, removal of weight restrictions and additional price top ups. The supply balance has swung in favour of the farmer.
Supplies. Supplies totalled 26,911 for week ending May 17th., down about 5,900 on the same week last year. Kill to date down 31,683 on 2019 levels. Y Bulls are back 30k, steers are up +10k, heifers are down -6k and cows are back -15k. However, when calves are removed, the overall adult kill is back closer to 46,000 head.
Numbers over the coming weeks expected to remain tight until the first of the grass cattle set to arrive.
Official Prices. DAFM reported Irish R3 steer prices for w/e May 10th was €3.67/kg incl vat. Heifers R3 €3.70/kg. Y Bulls O/R/U €3.33/€3.52/€3.61/kg. Cows P/O/R €2.72/€2.80/€2.99/kg.
UK cattle prices for w/e May 10th R3 steers at £3.31/kg, equivalent to €3.92/kg incl vat. R3 heifers at £3.30, equivalent to €3.91/kg and O3 cows at £2.43, equivalent to €2.87 incl vat.
Official cattle prices reported to the EU Commission on May 10th 2020. R3 Young Bulls c/kg excl vat; EU Average€3.40/kg, Germany €3.37/kg, France €3.64/kg, Spain €3.46/kg, Austria €3.51/kg Italy €3.67/kg Poland €2.62/kg. Steer Prices; Ireland €3.48/kg, UK €3.76/kg.
EU Young bull prices are down 1.84c/kg on the week and EU steers are up 3.3/kg on the previous week, with cows down 2.0c/kg and heifers down 1.0c/kg.
The latest Bord Bia Price Tracking data for R3 grades for w/e May 9th.
The resumption of some manufacturing plants and some reopening of food service at EU level has helped the trade. The reopening of McDonalds and Supermacs drive-through helped the cow trade.
APS. Irish processors applied for only 20 tonnes of APS. Total applications across the EU of 706 tonnes with 400t from Poland, 230t from Holland, 46t from Spain and 10t from Austria.
Live Exports. 4,648 cattle were exported in the week commencing 04/5/2020, 3,822 to EU (Except NI). Live exports for 2020 amount to 144,977 compared to 186,276 in 2019.
Calf exports of 112,383 year to date.
There were considerable difficulties with the Algerian live export trade over recent weeks, involving loading delays, payment difficulties and delays on the first shipment. IFA assisted up to about 15 farmers getting paid in full.
When the boat, the MV Sarah returned for the second shipment, difficulties occurred between the exporter and the DAFM on horned cattle, individual weighing and withdrawal periods on medications.
Working with the exporter and the DAFM, IFA asked Minister Creed to intervene directly, which he did and all of these issues were subsequently resolved but shipments were delayed and along with TB difficulties on some farms the exporter was unable to proceed and cancelled the shipment. The livestock carrier has left Ireland empty.
IFA Payment Policy. Insist on payment on the day, or ensure that you are selling through an outlet where payment is guaranteed or secure.

Beef Taskforce 
Chairman Michael Dowling wrote to IFA this week with an update on the various issues including the Grant Thornton reports into specifications and a breakdown of the beef price across the chain.
Marts
IFA has called for the marts to be reopened as soon as possible. IFA also pushing for support for the marts.
BEEP-S
Just over 27,000 farmers applied for the BEEP-S scheme, following an intensive campaign by IFA. It is estimated that some c600,000 cows are involved, which will require funding of c€52m as opposed to the €35m allocated, if a linear cut to the payment rates of €90 per cow on the first 10 and €80 on the remainder are to be avoided.
Support for Beef Farmers
Finishers Income. Finishers are still shipping serious losses. IFA will continue to push Minister Creed, the Government and the EU Commission hard to secure a direct payment for finishers to cover the COVID-19 and Brexit related losses on cattle sold this year.
At the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels Minister Creed sought exceptional aid for livestock producers under Articles 219 & 221 of CMO due to serious falls in prices. However, IFA is strongly of the view Minister Creed and the EU Commission must secure new money to deal with the COVID crisis.
IFA continue to lobby TDs and push Minister Creed and Government for a direct payment scheme to make up for the COVID and Brexit related cattle price losses incurred this Spring, including release of the €24m in unspent BEAM funding to assist beef finishers, who have incurred losses in the order of €200 per head.
Bord Bia Grass Based Beef and PGI status
Bord Bia has prepared proposals for an Irish Grass Fed Beef and PGI status application.
In summary the proposals cover animals who meet the following key criteria;
The majority of feed from grass (90% grass or grass forage throughout the animal’s lifetime)
Spend greater part of their life grazing (minimum of 220 days per year).
Steers and heifers up to 36 months of age, Grade O- or better and fat score 2+ to 4+.
Beef cows up to 120 months with conformation of O+ or better and fat score 2+ to 5.
Born, reared, finished and slaughtered in the geographical area.
Budget 2021
2019 Brexit Beef Price Losses
In line with the methodology used to calculate BEAM 1, IFA has calculated Brexit related cattle prices losses for beef farmers who sold cattle between May 2019 (when BEAM 1 ended) and December 31 2019.
These calculations compared 2015 cattle prices(pre-Brexit) with 2019 prices.
2019 – Brexit related price losses from May 12th to Dec 31st 2019 (BEAM II) = €160m.
2020 Brexit and COVID-19 Beef Price Losses
Since January 2020 finisher have continued to encounter Brexit related cattle price losses. However, from mid-March finishers were hit with a second wave of COVID-19 market disturbance beef price losses, which compounded their overall losses.
Using the same methodology IFA has calculated the Brexit related and COVID-19 related beef price losses as follow from Jan 1st2020 to May 17th 2020 as follows.
Brexit related price losses: €89.8m
COVID-19 related price losses: €21.2m
Overall Brexit/COVID-19 losses: €111m up to May 17th 2020.
2020 – Brexit and COVID-19 related beef price losses from Jan 1st to May 17th. 2020= €111m.
Support for Suckers
The national suckler cow herd of almost 1 million cows is the backbone of Ireland’s beef and livestock sector worth up to €3bn, providing top quality beef to make Ireland the fifth largest beef exporter in the world. The suckler beef sector also delivers essential socio-economic and environmental services and public goods, as well as providing a major carbon sink.
The support schemes for the suckler cow (BDGP and BEEP) have proven to be essential in terms of economic support and in improving efficiencies on environmental performance and delivery.
IFA proposes:
Suckler farmers need a targeted payment of €300 per cow, facilitated by a combination of CAP and national funding.
For 2020, a total of 27,000 suckler farmers have applied for the BEEP-S scheme, with up to 600,000 cows. At the payment rates of €90 on the first 10 cows and €80 on the remainder, the funding costs of this scheme will be €52m in 2020, as opposed to the €35m allocated in Oct 2019. Therefore, this scheme will need a budget injection of an additional €17m for 2020
The last annual payment under the current BDGP scheme is due in Nov/Dec 2020 and the BEEP-S scheme is an annual scheme.
For 2021, the IFA is proposing the BDGP is renewed and simplified with funding increased from €45m to €90m pa and the BEEP-S scheme is funded to the tune of €52m pa.
This would provide total funding of €142m pa for sucklers and enable payment rates of €290 per cow on the first 10 cows and €250 per cow on the remainder

Competition Law Literary Review – Draft provided to Task Force meeting, published following observations and feedback
Independent Review of customer requirements – currently in drafting stage, expected to be completed in 3 to 4 weeks
Independent Review of price composition – awaiting further data, some delays due to Covid-19
IFA highlighted the need for urgency in completing all three studies. When all three studies are complete the Task Force will discuss them in detail
Market update
IFA raised the impact of BREXIT and the need for clarity for cattle finishers
IFA highlighted the need to ensure processing continued and the importance of maintaining good Covid-19 controls to avoid any disruption
PGI application
A revised application document was circulated to members. The revised document includes a number of changes in areas identified by IFA including; transport, distance from processing plant, flexibility on days grazing, times for silage/ hay making, assessment of colour and impact of this on eligibility. A proposed monitoring group structure for the PGI Brand was also presented, the proposal consists of 2 farmer representatives, 2 processor representatives, 1 DAFM and 1 Bord Bia Representative.
The Task Force agreed in Principle to submitting a PGI application with issues remaining to be resolved in advance of the next Task Force meeting scheduled for the 12th
The changes achieved address some of the issues raised by IFA however further clarity is required in particular in relation to the assessment of the colour, the point at which the animal is deemed to meet the PGI standard and need for including a reference to the 2-hour travel time. The proposed monitoring group must have more farmer representation and clarity is required to ensure how ownership/control of the brand rests with farmers. The PGI proposal does not include all animals while the Grass Fed Standard does, Young Bulls and P grade Steers and Heifers are not included or cows below O+ confirmation. In addition, fat scores below 2+ are not eligible for steers, heifers or cows and above 4+ for steers and heifers. The PGI should seek to include as many animals as possible. The issue of NI access to the brand must be resolved.
Suckler Brand
Bord Bia have committed €1m a year in funding for each of the next 3 years to develop a brand specific for suckler beef, build awareness and consumer demand for the brand even if the application for EU Funding is unsuccessful.
IFA acknowledge the commitment on funding as a good starting point in developing a brand that will recognize the additional benefits of beef derived from the suckler herd.
Key issues to be clarified include, ownership/control of the brand and how the brand will be supplemented/interact with the PGI status.
It is important the PGI and the suckler brand are not competing identities and that the suckler brand is supported by the PGI standard.

€50 million Beef Finishers Payment
Former Minister Dara Calleary announced the details of the Beef Finishers Payment (BFP) on Wednesday 5th of August 2020.
The BFP was announced in recognition of the negative impact Covid-19 had on Irish beef prices. This impact was developed further by restrictions preventing them getting cattle to market and the closure of the food service market.
The BFP will be funded by the Irish exchequer and has been notified to the European Commission in accordance with the Covid-19 Temporary State Aid Framework.
It has been estimated that 42,000 farmers will be eligible to apply for the payment.
The significant economic activity of beef farmers and strong multiplier effect in rural communities was noted in the DAFM announcement.
Key Information: 
Applications: Opening date 19th August 2020. Closing date 9th September 2020.
Payment: €100 per eligible animal. Subject to a linear cut if over subscription occurs.
Reference Period: Applies to cattle slaughtered from the 1st February to 12th June 2020.
Conditions: Limit of 100 animals per herd. Applicant must be a member of the Bord Bia Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme or apply to become a member before the 30th of September 2020.
‘Eligible Animals’ Slaughtered:
Slaughtered in the reference period of 1 February to 12 June 2020.

Conditionality: Applicant must be a member of the Bord Bia Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme at the time of application, or undertake to become a member of a quality scheme prior to 30 September 2020.
Bord Bia Grass-fed standard and PGI
Since last the National Council Meeting, grass fed standard agreed with Bord Bia
The IFA made it very clear that there needs to be more consultation with farmers and much more clarity around many aspects of the proposal.
IFA highlighted some key issues including ownership and guarantees that price premiums will be paid back to farmers.
Since that meeting, Bord Bia have published their PGI Product Specification Document.
Main issues with proposed application for PGI status for Irish Grass Fed beef:
Ownership: Farmer ownership of the PGI is crucial.
Animals: Does not include all grades and young bulls have been excluded despite commitments previously made by Bord Bia that all categories of animals would be included if they met the grass-fed criteria.
Grass fed Criteria: The criteria state that in order to be deemed grass fed beef the animal must spend a minimum of 220days per year grazing. It also states that hay and silage are accepted as a grass-based diet. This begs the question: why the need for the minimum number of days grazing? This will be of particular importance for farmers in parts of the country that regularly have to deal with ongoing poor weather conditions.
Farm to Abattoir: The use of registered and approved hauliers only adds cost at farm level. There should be no issue with farmers transporting their own animals to the abattoir. In addition, Bord Bia have suggested that animals must go to a factory less than two hours away from the farm. This restricts a farmer’s ability to get the best possible price available, placing more power in the hands of the factories.
Colour: Bord Bia have added an extra layer of inspections, in the abattoir, assessing if the beef will meet a new colour criteria. The colour criteria call for ’cherry red colour’ and a ‘creaminess’ of fat, yet another hurdle for farmers in their attempt to get a fair price.
No return to farmer: Bord Bia confirmed to the Farming Independent that it does not have any research that shows European consumers will pay a premium for Irish grass-fed beef.
Finally, there are a variety of other technical aspects of the proposal that need clarification. As the proposal currently stands, it only adds another hoop for farmers to jump through, with no guaranteed returns.

Keep up to date on all IFA work and prices on ifa.ie/covid19.
EU Meat Market Observatory. IFA participated in the EU Commission Meat Market Observatory meeting in Brussels this week, where the Commission said the beef market is recovering slowly from Covid and prices are rising in most member states. EU exports are down 8% for the Jan-Arp period but imports are down 22%. IFA highlighted the major inadequacies in beef market supports in the CAP policy for a crisis like Covid and the ongoing uncertainties from Brexit. In a discussion on Farm to Fork, IFA highlighted the importance of a profitable and sustainable beef sector for rural areas and communities, land use and integration with other sectors like dairy.
10 Reasons Why Cattle Prices Should Rise.
IFA has set out 10 market facts on why cattle prices should rise.
Prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 44c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg.
AHBD report that UK steer price is at £3.68/kg, equivalent to €4.29/kg incl vat. and continuing to rise, up another 2.3p/kg for the latest reported week ended June 20th.  This is 48c/kg above the Irish price, which amounts to a price differential of €173 on an average steer.
Cattle price across the main EU markets are also recovering with retail sales      continue to show very strong growth and food service coming back as the Covid restrictions are eased.
The Bord Bia prime export benchmark price has moved ahead of the Irish price over the last 2 weeks, showing the improvement in market returns.
Factories agents and procurement managers are very active buying finished cattle in the marts and on line, paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices.
Northern Ireland factories are very active in the South, paying prices from 10 to 20c/kg above Irish prices.
The R3 steer price in Northern Ireland was £3.61/kg, which is equivalent to €4.20/kg.
The Northern Ireland LMC report that 785 cattle were exported live from the Republic to Northern Ireland for slaughter in the week to June 20.
Department of Agriculture AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on May 1st there was a reduction of 83,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12-24-month category and 10,000 in the 24-36 month category compared to 2019, meaning that supplies over the next number of months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels.
Retail consumption figures for Ireland continue to show very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks to May 17th., compared to 2019 levels. In the UK, retail data shows beef volume sales up 22.4% and value sales up 23.1%, for the 12-week period to May 17th compared to 2019, with stake sales up 24% and mince up 36%.
Beef Taskforce
IFA attended a Beef Taskforce meeting last week and called on the processors to increase prices in line with increased market returns.
IFA pointed out cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 40c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg.
IFA questioned consultants Grant Thornton on the investigation into the supply chain and insisted that the Minister must tell the beef factories and the retailers to co-operate fully and provide all the required price and margin information for this important investigation.
IFA also raised issues on the Bord Bia Grass fed and PGI proposals around the lack of proper consultation with farmers and the need for more engagement. The Chairman requested Bord Bia to re-engage and consult more with stakeholders to try and get broader agreement before proceeding.
BEEP-S
Just over 27,000 farmers applied for the BEEP-S scheme, following an intensive campaign by IFA. It is estimated that some c600,000 cows are involved, which will require funding of c€52m as opposed to the €35m allocated, if a linear cut to the payment rates of €90 per cow on the first 10 and €80 on the remainder are to be avoided.
€50m for Beef Finishers
Following a comprehensive assessment of the beef price losses incurred by finishers and detailed submissions to the Department of Agriculture and the EU Commission backed by an intensive lobbying campaign IFA secured Government funding of €50m for beef finishers.
IFA has met with the DAFM on how this funding should be allocated and made the following points in a detailed submission.
The scheme must be for cattle finishers and payment targeted at finishers who incurred the most financial losses.
All finished cattle should be covered in the scheme including steers, heifers, young bulls and cows, with the exception of cows with conformation score P and fat score 1 and calves. The Minister has made it clear factory owned and dealer owned cattle will not be covered.
The payment rate must be a minimum of €100 per finished animal.
Payments should apply to finished animals retrospectively from the announcement date by the Minister in order to prevent factories using the support in an anticompetitive way to manipulate prices on cattle going forward.
There should be no restrictive limit on the number of eligible animals per farm which qualify.
The terms and conditions of the scheme must be simple and farmer friendly.
There can be no conditionality attached to the scheme.
The full funding of €50m must be utilised and paid out under the scheme. The terms and conditions must be structured a way to ensure the total funding amount of €50million is paid out to farmers and none of the funds are left unused.
The application process should be simple and opened for farmers to apply immediately.
Payment should be made to all eligible applicants on or before the end of August, so as to ease the severe financial difficulties on finishing farms and also assist the weanling and store cattle trade in the second half of the year.
The payment should apply to all finished cattle sold in the marts, provided those cattle were slaughtered within 30 days of purchase. The payment should go to the farmer who sold the animal regardless of who purchased the animals in the mart.
The payment should apply to finished cattle exported live to Northern Ireland.
The payment should apply to finished cattle exported live to international markets.
It should be structured in such a way under EU state aids approval under the COVID-19 Temporary State Aid Framework so as to ensure all cattle finishers that apply get paid on all eligible cattle.
The scheme should positively accommodate farm partnerships and not in any way discriminate against individual farmer members in partnerships.
IFA is available for further consultation with the Department of Agriculture on the scheme.
Bord Bia Grass Fed Beef Standard and PGI status
IFA has met with Tara McCarthy and the Bord Bia team to try and sort out some of the issues around the Grass-fed proposal and PGI status.
IFA made it very clear that there needs to be more consultation with farmers and much more clarity around many aspects of the proposals.
On Grass fed, young bulls have to be treated the same as any other category of animals and measured against the same criteria. Making young bulls ineligible before they are even accessed against the criteria is not right.
IFA also sought clarification on a number of other aspects of the Grass-fed proposals including the ‘exclusion’ of the first 9 months of the animal’s life.
The PGI proposals need a more fundamental rethink. There are key issues around ownership and guarantees that price premiums will be paid back to farmers that have to be sorted out.

Director of Livestock Kevin Kinsella"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/market-conditions-justify-higher-beef-price-returns/,2020-10-29,Market Conditions Justify Higher Beef Price Returns,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has called on the meat factories to reflect the favourable market conditions in the UK in higher prices for cattle.
Prices in the UK continue to edge upwards and are now at the equivalent (vat incl) price of €4.47/kg for R4L steers.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said demand for beef in the UK market is strong and will improve further as stocks are built up for the lucrative Christmas trade.
“The higher than expected cattle kill to-date this year in the UK and the ‘lower cattle inventory’ all point towards increased demand in our primary export market for the coming months,” he said.
Turning to the supply situation here, Brendan Golden said most of the grass cattle have now moved through the system.  With the kill to-date up 47,000 on the same period last year, numbers are predicted to be tight for the back-end trade.
It’s predicted there will be 50,000 fewer cattle to kill between now and Christmas compared to last year. Exports to Northern Ireland have performed very strongly this year with numbers up almost 25,000 head on 2019 to nearly 50,000.
“Looking at the breakdown of overall exports, while numbers are down, the exports of finished cattle is up 16,000 head, which impacts directly on slaughter numbers for the remainder of the year,” he said.
Brendan Golden said the demand for beef in the UK market, tight domestic supplies and tighter numbers predicted here create a positive environment for factories to maximise returns from the market place for Irish beef.
He said meat factories have no excuse for allowing the current price gap to continue between Irish and UK prices.
He said farmers should dig in on price negotiations in the knowledge numbers will be tight, and the factories need the cattle to fill the lucrative Christmas orders with the supermarkets which have seen sales of meat surge throughout the COVID-19 restrictions."

IFA National Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy has called on the Department of Agriculture to change the reference years of the Sheep Welfare Scheme for the CAP transition period.”The reference years do not accurately reflect the current flock of many sheep farmers within the scheme and need to be changed,” he said.
IFA Calls For Grace Period For Farmers To Meet BDGP Female Replacement Criteria And Flexibility With Tolerances
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has called on the Minister for Agriculture to provide a ‘Grace’ period for farmers who have yet to meet the 50% female replacement target of 4- and 5- star animals and for flexibility on the tolerances for meeting the requirement where farmers are within 1 animal of meeting the 90% compliance or full compliance with this measure.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-livestock-chairman-critical-of-factories-cut-to-cow-prices/,2020-11-02,IFA Livestock Chairman Critical of Factories Cut to Cow Prices,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has strongly criticised factories for the level of price cuts on cow prices over the past week.
“The cuts of up 20c/kg over the past week in quoted prices is not justified in the market place. While cow prices have come under pressure in some markets, it is not of the level put forward by meat factories and must be rowed back,” he said.
Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong for in-spec cattle as the supermarket trade, which has performed strongly for beef throughout the COVID-19 restrictions, builds stocks for the lucrative Christmas trade.
Numbers of In-spec cattle are expected to tighten considerably over the coming weeks.  The anticipated tighter supplies of cattle in the UK should drive positive market conditions for Irish beef in our main export market.
Prices for steers are continuing at €3.60/kg to €3.65/kg with heifers making €3.65/kg to €3.70/kg,
“Factories are anxious to secure in-spec cattle and must close the gap with the UK prices to reflect the market conditions that exist. Prices in our main export market are strong and steady at the vat inclusive equivalent of €4.45/kg for R4L steers,” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-sheep-update-7th-november/,2020-11-07,Beef & Sheep Update 7th November,"IFA National Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said strong competition between factories for the tight supplies of finished lambs has pushed prices paid this week on by 5 – 10c/kg.
Lambs are making €5.30/kg to €5.40/kg with deals to €5.50/kg available. The mart trade for fleshed lambs is outperforming factory prices in cases. Cull ewes are ranging from €2.60/kg to €2.85/kg
IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden strongly criticised the factory attempts to cut cow prices. Some factories dropped quotes by up 20c/kg. Prices paid remain stronger than quotes, good quality cows are making €3.20/€3.40/kg, P/O grade €2.70/€2.90/kg.
Market conditions are strong as the supermarket trade, which has performed well throughout the COVID-19 restrictions, build stocks for the Christmas trade.
Steers €3.60/3.65/kg, heifers €3.65/3.70/kg.
Brendan Golden called on the factories to reflect the market conditions of tighter projected supplies and strong supermarket demand by closing the current gap with the UK prices. Prices in our main export market are strong and steady at the vat inclusive equivalent of €4.45/kg for R4L steers.

He said the supermarket trade has performed very well throughout the year for beef and demand is increasing in the lead in to Christmas.
“Supplies of in spec cattle in particular are predicted to tighten considerably over the coming weeks and this is very evident in the factories’ attempts to secure cattle to meet market demand,” he said.
Brendan Golden said the cattle price in the UK continues to rise and with domestic supplies also projected to tighten, market conditions justify better returns from factories.  The UK price for R4L steers jumped 5c/kg to the vat inclusive equivalent of €4.57/kg in the past week.
He said factories must start reflecting the true value of our most important market to farmers.
Brendan Golden said farmers should dig in and sell hard.  Deals well above quoted prices or flat deals for plainer Angus and Hereford cattle of up to €3.95/kg at this stage are available."

Brendan Golden said €3.65/kg is freely available for bullocks with deals to €3.70/kg and above paid to secure numbers over the weekend.  Heifers are starting off a base of €3.70/kg, with €3.75/kg and above paid as factories fill orders for the lucrative Christmas trade.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said these increases are just about keeping pace with the price increases in the UK and must push on to reflect the full benefits of the current market conditions for beef farmers. The equivalent price for R4L steers in GB is €4.54/kg.
Brendan Golden said agents and factories are very active on the ground to secure cattle. 
He said numbers are expected to continue to tighten over the coming weeks.
“The cow trade also strengthened this week. Prices increased by a similar 5-10c/kg in some factories. P grade cows are making from €2.70/€2.90/kg, O grades €2.80 to €3/kg, with good quality R/U grading cows pushing to €3.30/kg and above in some cases,” he said."

After the initial shock of lockdown and the closure of foodservice outlets, consumption has recovered and is only back about 2-5%. Demand has remained steady so far, but it assumed this is due to countries stockpiling rather than a critical demand for product.

Activities
Meeting with DAFM – Nitrates 
Current derogation due to end December 2021
Final decision on derogation for 2022-2025 wont be made until September 2021
Suggestion that more conditionality would be placed on larger herds (>200 cows)
5000 farmers are stocked between 170-210kgN/ha
7000 farmers are stocked above 210kgN/ha
Eastern European Member states cannot apply for derogation
New measures introduced in the new SI 40/2020. All farms stocked over 170kg (INCLUDING THOSE THAT EXPORT SLURRY) must:
 feed concentrate of less than 15% crude protein from 1st April to 15th September. 
Adopt a liming programme 
Use LESS for slurry spread after the 15th April 2021
Not use watercourses as a source of drinking water and Fence watercourses 1.5m from top of the bank – permissible to cross cattle across watercourses to get to land parcels. 
The excretion rate for dairy cows has increased from 85kgN/year to 89kgN/year. This will increase your Stocking rate next year. 
Key issue -> will the suite of actions brought in under nitrates exclude intensive dairy farmers from participation in an eco-scheme? Need to ensure suite of actions are applicable and practical for dairy farmers.

https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/eu-commission-must-address-contradictions-in-the-green-deal-cap-and-trade-policy/,2020-12-01,"EU Commission must address contradictions in the Green Deal, CAP and trade policy","Speaking at the first trans-national BovINE meeting for the European Beef industry organised by Poland, IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the EU Commission must address the serious contradictions and lack of policy co-ordination under the Green deal, CAP and Trade policy. 
“Under the Green Deal, the EU is driving up costs and want organic production standards at conventional prices, while at the same time under the Mercosur trade deal, the Commission is importing beef that fails to meet EU standards and would be illegal to produce in the EU.”
The online BovINE meeting entitled Sustainable Beef farming; Policy and Practice in the context of the Green Deal was also addressed by the Polish Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development Grzegorz Puda, Thomas Sanchez from the EU COPA-Cogeca Beef and Veal Group and Jacek Zarzecki, President of the Polish Association of Beef Cattle Breeders and Producers.
Brendan Golden said the Green Deal is very ambitious and will have a major impact on farming. “It’s a top down driven plan from the EU Commission and needs detailed assessment based on facts and solid science.” 
The IFA Livestock Leader said the EU family farm model and economic sustainability needs to be placed at the top of the Green deal agenda by both politicians and policy makers.
On the Green Deal and CAP, Brendan Golden said the EU Commission must learn the hard lessons from Covid-19 and recognise the importance of health, food security and food sovereignty for Europe. 
“Never was it more important in the history of the European Union to have a strong EU and CAP Budget which underpins a strong CAP and a sustainable and resilient food supply chain based on family farms,” he said. 
Brendan Golden farmers are the key in terms of delivering on the environment sustainability but their economic sustainability is critical. The Green Deal makes it clear that farmers earn only half of the average EU worker. He said “Farmers cannot be green if they are always in the red.”
On the priorities for the CAP, Brendan Golden said with the EU CAP budget negotiations concluded, the funding issues now turns to the Irish Government and the critical need for very strong co-financing. 
“Important issues include targeted payment for vulnerable sectors like suckler cows and a payment for carbon sequestration additional to the CAP budget.” 
He said farmers are also very concerned about eco scheme proposals in Pillar I, which involve additional environmental compliance without any additional budget."

Beef Market Tracking: Prime Irish Composite Price 10c/kg below Prime Export Benchmark Price
Supermarket trade: The supermarket trade in the UK continues to perform strongly for beef. The 3 key measures of volume, price and spend show growth in the 52- and 12-week period analysis
Market Conditions: The current market conditions justify stronger factory prices for farmers. In our main market, the UK, supermarket demand on the lead in to Christmas has strengthened further, GB cattle prices are increasing week on week. There is no justification for Irish prices to be 10c/kg below the Prime Export Benchmark Price. In spec cattle numbers are tight. Factories must close the gap with prices in the UK, the 5-10c/kg price rise this week does not go far enough. Factories must deliver real price increases that reflect the strength of our main market.
Live Exports. 2,868 cattle were exported in the week ending 9/11/2020. Live exports for 2020 to-date amount to 248,311 compared to 279,621 in 2019.

IFA met with DAFM and sought the provision of up-to-date statements for farmers that are easy to follow to measure compliance for the BEAM scheme 5% reduction. 
These are critical payments for farmers, which was delivered by IFA following an intensive campaign highlighting the impact of Brexit on beef prices.
IFA have called on the Department of Agriculture to make this information available as soon as possible to avoid any market disruption or farmers inadvertently failing to comply with the requirement.

Marts in Level 5
In advance of the Government implementing Level 5 restrictions IFA highlighted the importance of ensuring the mart trade and the meat processors were facilitated in continuing to function as close to normal as is possible to avoid any disruption to the marketing of animals
Following the announcement of the Level 5 restrictions and the operating procedures for marts IFA the made a detailed submission to the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue to facilitate purchasers at mart sales. 
Over the 450,000 cattle are traded through the marts in the October to December period.
385,000 of these cattle were sold in October and November in 2019, with weanling sales the main driver of numbers.
The online bidding system worked well in some marts, however, there are huge concerns about marts operating exclusively under this system, and in particular at the time of year when throughput is at peak numbers.
IFA called for the facilitation of a strictly limited number of buyers around the ring, with full Government guidelines for social distancing and the wearing of masks applied.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-should-sell-hard-as-beef-prices-strengthen/,2020-12-03,Farmers Should Sell Hard As Beef Prices Strengthen,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said cattle prices have strengthened again this week as supplies continue to tighten.
Last week’s kill dropped by a further 373 head to 36,464, with steers dropping by over 2,000 head on the week.  Heifer and cow numbers were stronger.
“The continual tightening of supplies of in-spec cattle and strong market conditions are driving the trade as factories fill orders,” he said.
Factories are paying €3.70 to €3.75/kg for bullocks, €3.75 to €3.80/kg for heifers with some deals higher, including flat prices for selective lots.
Brendan Golden said the gap in the ‘Prime Export Benchmark’ price has only closed by 2c/kg with the Irish price currently 8c/kg below, clearly showing further capacity in the market place for stronger prices.
He said factories must reflect the market realities and farmers should sell hard to maximise returns in the current strong market conditions.
He said cow prices have also increased this week and are ranging from €2.90 to €3.40/kg depending on grade."

Brendan Golden welcomed the commitment from the Department of Agriculture that a tolerance on meeting the 90% of the female replacement criteria in the BDGP scheme will be provided. 
The acceptance now of farmers who are within one animal of meeting the 90% requirement, as being 90% compliant, will significantly reduce the penalties for these farmers.Up to date compliance with the BEAM 5% requirement statements will be issued by DAFM to all farmers.

Irish dairy exports are almost identical to 2019-YTD. The top two products traded for the month of September in each destination are listed in the table above. Butter exports to the USA are ahead of this time last year, what is worth noting is that this growth has persisted despite the presence of trade levies and the product commands a premium. It is crucial that the sector focus on products that command a premium rather than depend on trading commodities.

The UK accounts for 44% of all our beef exports and 20% of lamb exports. IFA’s Brexit Emergency Plan sets out six key measures that are needed to safeguard Irish and European agriculture:
The EU and the UK must maintain the closest possible trading relationship, but the EU Single Market must be protected.
It is essential to maintain a level playing field with corresponding standards on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment
Burdensome delays such as control of goods and sanitary and phytosanitary inspections and veterinary certificates which will lead to delays at borders and increase costs for both sides must be avoided.
Access to the UK market must be tariff-free and quota-free
There must be no return by the UK to a cheap food policy
European Agri sector must be a priority for support from the €5bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve.

Live Trade: Total live exports stood at 24,807 head to the 01 October 2020
Select and Sell: As always, the advice is to move lambs as they become fit"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/tight-supplies-and-strong-supermarket-demand-driving-beef-trade/,2021-01-07,Tight Supplies and Strong Supermarket Demand Driving Beef Trade,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said a combination of tight supplies and strong supermarket demand is driving the beef trade.
Brendan Golden said prices in the UK increased by the equivalent of 4c/kg in the run in to Christmas.
“Supermarket sales of beef throughout the COVID-19 restrictions have performed well, with strong volume and price increases recorded for 2020, a situation that is likely to continue,” he said.
Last year’s kill came in at over 60,000 head more than the 2019 levels, when predictions were for a reduction of in the region of 50,000 head. This earlier movement of animals in 2020 is likely to have a significant impact on numbers of slaughter fit cattle in the coming weeks and months.
He said prices for steers have moved to a base of €3.75/kg with heifers selling off a base of €3.80/kg.
Brendan Golden reminded farmers the increase to 5.6% in the flat rate vat is the equivalent of almost 1c/kg on beef price at current levels.
Cow prices have also strengthened and are ranging from €2.90/kg to €3.40/kg with deals being done for select lots of younger and better-quality cows. The young bull trade has also moved on with R/U grading bulls making €3.70 to €3.80/kg.
Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong in our main export market and with the worst-case scenario for Brexit avoided.  This market must be built on and any trade distortions from logistical access issues cannot find their way back to farmers.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said despite beef prices improving, they continue to fall well short of breakeven levels.
“To address this, the approach must include strong recognition of beef and suckler farming in the new CAP and the removal of beef from the EU market that does not meet the production standards on Irish and EU farms,” he said.
Brendan Golden said the double standards applied by the EU cannot be allowed continue.  The Mercosur deal must be rejected and the current access allowed for South American beef that does not meet our environmental welfare production standards must be removed from the market place."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-farmers-must-be-first-in-line-for-brexit-fund/,2021-01-14,Beef Farmers Must be First in Line for Brexit Fund,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have strengthened this week.
He said steers are making €3.75 to €3.80/kg, with heifers between €3.80 and €3.85/kg in most factories.  There are deals above these levels available for larger lots and Angus cattle.
Brendan Golden said market demand is strong, driven by the high volumes of beef sales in supermarkets.  Supplies are predicted to remain tight.
He said the cow price has also strengthened this week and is ranging from €3/kg to €3.40/kg, depending on grade.
Young bull prices have also risen in the past week and are ranging in general from €3.60 to €3.80/kg for O/R and U grades.
Brendan Golden said while there is uncertainty around some logistical issues and access to the UK market, demand is strong and beef prices must push on and reflect market conditions.
“Market returns to beef farmers remain a long way off the breakeven price of €4.50/kg and this is not sustainable,” he said.
Brexit has impacted directly on beef farmers since the vote was taken in 2016, primarily through the sterling fluctuation, and this must be addressed in the €1.05bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve announced for Ireland.
Brendan Golden said beef farmers must be first in line for strong and meaningful supports, without pre-conditions."

Sean Dennehy said demand for lambs is very strong from factories and prices continue to push on.
He said lambs are making €6.35 to €6.50/kg with deals of €6.60/kg available and above in cases as factories actively source lambs to meet market demand. The mart trade is also performing very strongly for all types and is particularly strong outlet for heavier lambs. He said it is important to keep lambs moving as they become fit but sell hard with up to 20c/kg difference in prices offered.

He said cow prices are starting at €3/kg for P grades and moving up to €3.50/kg for good quality R/U grading cows, O grades are making €3.10 to €3.30/kg. R/U grading young bulls are making €3.75 to €3.95/kg.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said market conditions are strong, underpinned by high volume and value of sales of beef in supermarkets, and tight supplies of finished cattle.
“Projections are for 80,000 fewer cattle to be available for slaughter this year compared to 2020.  When the strong performance of beef in supermarkets is factored in, where both volume and price have shown huge growth, this creates a positive market environment that must be reflected in beef prices to farmers,” he said.
Brendan Golden said Irish prices are just about keeping pace with the Prime Export composite price, which reflects the market conditions in our main markets.
“The Prime Irish Composite price is currently reported at €3.73/kg (excl. Vat) which is 3c above the Prime Export Benchmark price of €3.70/kg and must continue to push on,” he said.
The breakeven price is €4.50/kg, according to Teagasc, and Brendan Golden said we are still a long way from that."

He said market conditions are strong and the numbers of suitable lambs are tight.  This attempt by factories is opportunistic and unjustified.
Prices offered are ranging from €6.20 to €6.30/kg, with some factories trying to buy lambs for less. Cull ewes are making €2.90 to €3.10/kg.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/strong-market-conditions-must-be-reflected-in-beef-price/,2021-02-01,Strong Market Conditions Must be Reflected in Beef Price,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said strong supermarket demand for beef continues to drive the trade.
“Despite some factories attempting to dampen the trade this week, factory agents remain very active on the ground and in marts trying to fill orders,” he said.
Prices in GB and NI are strong and steady, reflecting the demand in UK supermarkets where beef sales continue to perform strongly. The latest R4L price for steers in GB is the vat inclusive equivalent of €4.64/kg. He said the latest Prime Irish Composite price is 5c/kg above the Export Benchmark Price.
Brendan Golden said prices this week are €3.80/kg for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers, with higher deals for larger and specialist lots. Y Bulls are ranging from €3.75 to €3.95/kg for R and U grades.
Cows are starting at €3/kg for P grades and pushing up to €3.60/kg at the top end for good grading continentals, with a lot of cows selling in the €3.20-€3.40/kg range.
He said the increased value of consumer purchasing and spending on beef in supermarkets must be reflected in prices to farmers.
“The predictions are for 80,000 fewer cattle this year.  Combined with the performance of beef in the key supermarket trade, this creates a positive market environment that must be reflected in beef prices paid to farmers,” he said.
Brendan Golden said farmers unable to secure the higher factory prices should seriously consider the mart trade, where factory agents have been particularly active for finished cattle over the past few weeks."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/irish-beef-farmers-sacrificed-by-commissions-trade-policy/,2021-02-03,Irish Beef Farmers Sacrificed By Commission’s Trade Policy,"IFA President Tim Cullinan said the EU Commission must address the serious contradictions and lack of policy co-ordination under the Green deal, CAP and trade policies.
“Commissioner Wojciechowski admitted to MEPs that of all the sectors considered in the Cumulative Impact Assessment on EU Free Trade Agreements, the beef sector stands out as the most affected,” he said.
The study, conducted by the EU’s Joint Research Centre, updated the European Commission’s Assessment from 2016 and looks at the impact of 12 EU Free Trade Agreements with partner countries with modelling conducted out to 2030.
The report estimates the beef sector to reduce production by 0.5%. (tonnes)
“Under the Green deal, the EU is driving up costs and wants organic production standards at conventional prices, while at the same time under trade deals, the Commission is importing beef that fails to meet EU standards and would be illegal to produce in the EU.”
The IFA President said the Mercosur trade deal cannot progress and the existing access granted to beef not produced to our standards, including environmental, societal, traceability and animal health and welfare must be stopped.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the latest beef market tracker price shows Irish prices running 5c/kg ahead of the Export Benchmark Price, which is at €3.70/kg. This leaves beef prices up to 80c/kg below breakeven prices based on Teagasc calculations.
Brendan Golden said the full benefits of the strong supermarket trade for beef in the UK and throughout the EU is undermined by the acceptance of these substandard products to fill some of the demand.
UK supermarkets over the Christmas period increased beef sales by 1.4k/t or 18%, but Irish beef farmers are not seeing the full benefits of this as a result of the flawed and contradictory EU policies on trade.
He said this clearly highlights the dysfunction of the EU beef market caused by the double standards of policy makers who continue to ignore how beef is produced in these countries, while increasing demands on Irish beef farmers.
Brendan Golden said the EU Commission cannot defend current or future trade agreements when it shows that by 2030 beef imports into the EU can increase by up to 100,000t and in the process reduce beef prices for Irish and EU farmers by a further 2.2%, in a sector that is already accepted as extremely vulnerable and operating on a below cost basis.
He said this week factories are slowing the kill and attempting to ease prices with some quoting €3.80/kg for heifers.  Most cattle are moving at a base of €3.80 for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers.
Predictions are for tighter supplies for the year ahead, with our kill projected to be down 80,000 on last year and UK prime cattle numbers projected to be back 5%. This should create a positive market environment for Irish beef if it’s not continually undermined by flawed EU trade policies.
He said at the same time Irish farmers are seeing the value of the CAP payments eroded through the inclusion of additional measures that reduce on farm efficiency and productivity.
He said Irish farmers produce to the highest standards demanded by the EU and must not be undermined in our key markets, where prices are depressed by the flood of cheap and substandard imports.
The EU cannot continue on the diverging paths of higher standards on Irish beef farmers and erosion of the value of the CAP while at the same time selling out on our key markets for beef."

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/strong-beef-market-doesnt-justify-talking-down-price/,2021-02-08,Strong Beef Market Doesn’t Justify Talking Down Price,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said attempts by the meat factories to talk down the trade are not justified based on the latest market reports.
He said the Prime Export Benchmark price for the latest week has increased by 5c/kg, with the Irish price not keeping pace, only increasing by 2c/kg over the same period.
Brendan Golden said the supermarket price for beef in the UK has strengthened in the past week and sales remain strong.
Beef prices in the UK are strong and steady, rising over 7p/kg since the beginning of January and with sterling strengthening by 3% over the same period to 87.5p/€, market conditions for Irish meat factories are favourable.
Supplies of finished cattle are tight, in addition UK production for the year is predicted to contract by 5%.
Bullocks and heifers have been bought at €3.80 and €3.85/kg by factories for this week and factory agents remain active in marts sales for finished cattle.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said the double standards applied by the EU when it comes to trade deals in comparison to the standards imposed on Irish and EU farmers is not helping the situation. “Our key EU and UK markets continue to be undermined by imports from countries that are not meeting our production standards,” he said.
The current Prime Export Benchmark price of €3.76/kg, which is based on prices in our key markets, highlights the dysfunction of the EU policy when it comes to beef farmers, an approach that must be stopped. This price is up to 80c/kg below production costs for Irish beef farmers.
At the IFA AGM last month, Taoiseach Micheál Martin talked about realigning food prices with production costs. IFA has continuously raised this issue at national and EU level.
“We must start seeing meaningful action on this front and the first steps must be to reject the Mercosur deal and remove the existing sub-standard imports from the market place. In addition, supermarkets have a key role in this and the influence they have been allowed exert in food pricing throughout the EU must be curtailed,” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-meet-mii-on-beef-price-cuts/,2021-02-11,IFA Meet MII On Beef Price Cuts,"IFA President Tim Cullinan led an IFA delegation to meet Meat Industry Ireland (MII) on the recent price cuts attempted by factories.
He told the industry representative body the recent attempts by factories to reduce beef prices are not justified based on current market information, and farmers have reacted angrily to these attempts by factories.
He said the Bord Bia Prime Export Benchmark price tracker for the latest week, which is a composite of prices in our main export markets, does not show anything like the cuts factories are trying to enforce here.
Beef prices in the UK are strong and steady, rising over 7p/kg since the beginning of January and with sterling strengthening by 3% over the same period to 87.6p/€, market conditions for Irish meat factories are favourable.
Supplies of finished cattle are tight and estimated to reduce by up to 80,000 head this year.  UK production for the year is predicted to contract by 5%.
Recognising there are clearly ongoing issues with the food service sector due to COVID-19 controls, Tim Cullinan said the supermarket price for beef in the UK strengthened in the past week and sales remain strong as purchasing habits have evolved throughout the past year and are replicated by EU consumers.
The IFA President said MII were left in no doubt that undermining of the market conditions by meat factories is not acceptable.
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden highlighted the level of farmer frustration at the attempts by factories to reduce prices and the increased production costs associated with finished cattle at this stage of the year. In addition, he said meal prices continue to rise.
Brendan Golden said the situation is further compounded by the double standards applied by the EU when it comes to trade deals in comparison to the standards imposed on Irish and EU farmers. “Our key EU and UK markets continue to be undermined by imports from countries not meeting our production standards,” he said."

IFA National Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the issue of new entrants to the Sheep Welfare Scheme must be resolved.  This follows the Minister’s success in securing 2017 as the reference year from the EU Commission for this year. Sean Dennehy said the objective must be to accurately reflect the levels of activity on farms.  New entrants in particular are not having their sheep numbers recognised. “The scheme conditions, which require new entrants to apply effectively within a year of starting, creates an anomalous situation that unfairly penalises them. This can and must be addressed in the Terms and Conditions of the scheme for 2021,” he said.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/no-justification-for-lower-factory-prices/,2021-02-12,No Justification For Lower Factory Prices,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the latest Beef Market Tracker show prices in our key export markets remain strong and steady, increasing by 1c/kg in the last week.
Brendan Golden said the moves by meat factories to undermine the trade are not justified based on the most recent market information published today.
He said numbers of cattle are tight and supermarket demand remains strong for beef.
Brendan Golden said factories cannot justify dropping prices when the Prime Export Benchmark price, compiled by Bord Bia, continues to show strengthening prices in our key markets for beef.
He said beef farmers have reacted angrily to this move by factories at a time when production costs are at their highest on beef farms.
“In our meeting with MII earlier this week, we left the industry representative body in doubt that this approach by factories is unacceptable,” he said.
Brendan Golden said despite some factories quoting lower, base prices of €3.75 and €3.80/kg have been paid by factories this week for suitable bullocks and heifers.
He said farmers should reject the lower quoted prices."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/market-conditions-for-beef-remain-strong/,2021-02-18,Market Conditions For Beef Remain Strong,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef remains strong.  He said the Export Benchmark Price of €3.77/kg continues to edge upwards, reflecting beef prices in our key export markets.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said the latest published supermarket sales of beef in the UK, to the end of January, show continued growth for beef sales both in terms of volume and price.
The spend on beef in supermarkets for the 12-week period to the 24th January year on year increased by 15.8% and volume increased by 13%, combined with sterling strengthening, creates favourable market conditions for beef.
He said supplies of suitable cattle are tight.  When last week’s kill is corrected for finished cattle, the kill was 29,780, which is over 7,000 fewer than the corresponding week in 2020.  The corrected kill to-date is almost 19,000 below the same period last year.
Tight supplies of cattle are predicted for the year.  Irish throughput is projected to be back by up to 80,000 head for the year and UK finished cattle numbers are expected to reduce by 5% compared to last year.
Brendan Golden said attempts by factories to undermine the trade with lower quotes are unjustified and are meeting very strong resistance from farmers selling cattle.
He said in general prices are continuing at €3.75 to €3.80/kg for bullocks and heifers despite some factories quoting lower prices. He said some farmers are securing prices above these levels as factories compete for the limited supplies of suitable cattle that are available. The cow trade in the main is steady, starting at €2.90/kg for P grades with most moving into €3/kg and higher on flat deals with O grades, quotes for O grades are between €3 and €3.15/kg with R and U grades from €3.30 to €3.50/kg in general with some higher prices. R and U grading Young bulls are making from €3.60 to €3.80/kg.
Demand from factory agents in marts for all types of finished cattle is strong.
“In our meeting with MII last week, we left the meat industry representative body in doubt that the attempts by factories to undermine the market conditions is unjustified and unacceptable. Winter finishers have the highest cost of production sector in beef farming and are experiencing continual input cost increases and beef prices must reflect these facts,” he said.
Brendan Golden also highlighted the double standards of EU trade policies and the impact these are having on the viability of Irish beef farmers. He said we are seeing the standards and production costs on our farms continually increase while trade deals allow our market be undermined by substandard imports.
Beef farmers are also dealing with the fall out of the Brexit vote since 2016, where the devaluation of sterling that took place impacted directly on our prices, a situation that has not recovered and must be taken into account in the Brexit Adjustment Fund, in addition to any obstacles that are encountered in accessing our main market.
He said beef farmers must be first in line for this fund, having experienced the Brexit impact directly since 2016."

Sean Dennehy said there must be a national ownership database for all dogs that allows those responsible for them be identified.  There must also be appropriate sanctions to act as a deterrent for those who allow their animals to cause this devastation on sheep farms and there must be resources put in place to enforce these sanctions.
He said this is an issue that effects all sheep farmers and it’s not confined to people who are out walking dogs. Frequently, these attacks on sheep are as result of dog owners allowing their pets roam free while they are away at work, or at night time. Dog owners are responsible for having their dogs under control and must be accountable for them at all times.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/unjustified-beef-price-cuts-out-of-line-with-export-bench-price/,2021-02-22,Unjustified Beef Price Cuts Out Of Line With Export Bench Price,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have strengthened in recent days as tight supplies and strong farmer resistance to the lower and unjustified quotes from factories takes effect.
The Prime Export Benchmark Price for the latest week is steady at €3.76/kg, while the equivalent Irish price dropped 5c/kg, which underlines how unjustified the price cuts are.
Steers are making €3.75 to €3.80/kg, with heifers making €3.80 to €3.85/kg. The cow trade is steady, ranging from €2.90 for P grades to €3.40/kg for R and U grades with some higher prices.  Young bulls are ranging from €3.60 to €3.80/kg for R and U grades.
He said IFA left MII in no doubt in our meeting that undermining of the market place by meat factories will not be tolerated and beef prices must reflect the full value of our key markets.
“Supplies of finished cattle are extremely tight. UK slaughter-fit cattle are predicted to be back 5% this year and sterling has continued to strengthen since the end of January. It’s currently at 86p, creating positive market conditions for Irish beef,” he said.
Brendan Golden said factories must reverse the price drops of recent weeks and reflect the full value of the market place in cattle prices.
“While sterling is strengthening, it’s still almost 20% behind the pre-Brexit vote levels and impacting directly on incomes for beef farmers.  This is further compounded by sub-standard imports that are allowed into the EU to undermine our key market. The Mercosur trade deal that will allow an additional 100,000t of substandard product into our key markets must be stopped,” he said.
The Brexit Adjustment Fund must prioritise beef farmers who have borne the brunt of the Brexit impact.
Brendan Golden said winter finishers are also dealing with the impact of increasing input supplies. The breakeven price estimated by Teagasc at €4.50/kg is a long way from current prices."

He said the Bord Bia Price tracker shows the Prime Export Benchmark price increasing by 4c/kg to €3.80/kg, while the Prime Irish Composite price dropped by 3c/kg to €3.68/kg.
The IFA President said this level of price differential and divergence is unjustified and factory prices must increase.
IFA will be holding an online meeting next Tues, March 9th at 8.30pm for beef farmers, highlighting the seriousness of the situation on beef farms.

“Our beef processors must increase prices in line with the positive market conditions that exist for beef as clearly shown in the Export Benchmark Price which reflects the market prices in our key UK and EU markets for beef,” he said.
“Farmers are very angry at the cynical and unjustified price cutting that has gone over the past few weeks,” he said.
Tim Cullinan said IFA left the factory representatives MII in no doubt that this behaviour is unacceptable.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong in our key export markets and supplies of finished cattle are extremely tight, a trend that is expected to continue.
He said Bord Bia predict the numbers of cattle available for processing to reduce by between 60,000 and 80,000 for the year and UK supplies of prime cattle are projected to be down 5% for the year.
Sales of beef in supermarkets have performed very well throughout the COVID-19 restrictions and is off-setting the loss of the food service sector.
He said demand is expected to increase as lockdown restrictions ease with the roll out of the vaccination programmes and the food service sector starts to return to normal.
In the intervening period, he said with Easter just a month away demand will increase for beef in supermarkets and with supplies remaining tight creates favourable market conditions.
Brendan Golden said factories must reflect the full value of the market place in prices paid to farmers.
He said steers are making €3.75/kg and heifers €3.80/kg this week, with higher deals for larger lots and increased breed bonuses available despite lower quotes from some factories. Factory agents are very active in marts for forward store and finished cattle, highlighting the demand that exists for beef.
Brendan Golden said farmers should continue to reject the lower quoted prices to maximise returns. He said the cow trade is starting at €3.00/kg for P grades and moving to €3.50/kg for better quality R and U grading cows, Young Bulls are ranging from €3.60 to €3.85/kg."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/no-hiding-place-for-factories-as-demand-for-beef-grows/,2021-03-06,No Hiding Place for Factories as Demand for Beef Grows,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices in our key markets have strengthened over the past week, rising 3c/kg in the UK.
Brendan Golden said demand from supermarkets is strong and cattle numbers are tight.
“There is no hiding place for factories.  Prices must push on to reflect the demand for beef in the UK and EU markets,” he said.
The Export Benchmark Price, which IFA has consistently highlighted as the reality of the market place, show prices in our key markets reflecting the demand for beef by increasing each week.
Brendan Golden said factories and their agents are having to work hard to secure supplies and farmers should not accept lower quotes offered.
Steers are making €3.80/kg and heifers €3.85/kg, with higher deals for larger and specialist lots. Young Bulls are making up to €3.90/kg, cows are in strong demand and very few are selling below €3.00/kg.  Better quality cows are moving at €3.50/kg and over, in some cases.
“Cattle finishers are experiencing continual increases in production costs and the undermining of the market by factories is not acceptable.   The gradual re-opening of the food service sector will drive demand in addition to the seasonal increase for beef for the Easter holiday which is approaching,” he said.
He said farmers understand the issues with Brexit and COVID-19. However, this is no excuse for factories failing to reflect the current market conditions in beef prices.
Brendan Golden said the breakeven price for finishers according to Teagasc is €4.50/kg, current prices are a long way off this and market conditions justify a closing of this gap."

Supermarket trade; The supermarket trade in the UK continues to perform strongly for beef. The 3 key measures of volume, price and spend show growth in the 52- and 12-week period analysis. 
Supplies; Supplies of cattle are predicted to be tight for the year in Ireland and the UK. Bord Bia predict Irish supplies to be back 60,000 to 80,000 head compared to last year with UK supplies predicted to be back 5% for the year. 
Latest DAFM Kill figures; 
 Market Conditions; The current market conditions do not justify the price cuts imposed by meat factories. The Export Benchmark Price has strengthened further showing the demand for beef in our key export markets. Supermarket demand for beef is strong and supplies are tight. Over the course of the past week prices have started to edge upwards with 5 to 10c/kg more paid than the lower quotes offered by some factories.  
IFA Activity; Following the unjustified dropping of quotes by factories and the divergence from the Export Benchmark Price IFA called for the Beef Task Force to be convened immediately and wrote to the chairman of the Task Force. IFA met MII and left the industry representative body in doubt that undermining of the market by factories was not acceptable. IFA have continued to highlight the facts of the marketplace and provide farmers with the factual information to counter the factory narrative. 
BREXIT 
Beef farmers continue to feel the impact of Brexit since the vote in 2016. The devaluation of sterling that occurred is impacting directly on the value of our beef exports to the UK. Since 2015 sterling has weakened by over 20%. 
Additional controls that will come into effect on April 1st for accessing the UK market will require veterinary certification for each consignment and pre arrival notification to UK Authorities. 
There are issues with certification of mince and other such processed meat products to be resolved before April 1st. 
July 1st physical checks on consignments will commence for products entering the UK. 
The 40-day residency requirement for live exports between the UK and the EU will have a severe impact on this trade where animals are sold through sales. DAFM figures to the end of October 2020 show a total of 8,246 animals exported. This consisted of 7,360 dairy bred animals and 886 beef bred animals. 
Beef and suckler farmers must be first in line to have the impacts of Brexit addressed through the Brexit Adjustment Fund. 
Mercosur 
The Mercosur trade deal will provide access for an additional 99,000/t of sub-standard beef to our key markets if allowed progress. 
IFA have highlighted the double standards applied by the commission in this trade deal compared to the standards demanded from Irish and EU beef farmers. 
IFA have called on the Irish Government to reject this deal. 
Irish beef farmers will be most impacted if this additional sub-standard beef is allowed onto the EU and UK marketplace. 
IFA are fighting a strong campaign at EU level to have the deal rejected. 
IFA have met the Commissioner for Agriculture and called for this deal to be stopped. 
Live Exports   
Live cattle exports in 2021 have picked up in recent weeks after a slow start,  
For the week ending February 13th live cattle exports reached 4,975 head  
The movement of cattle to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly into 2021. 
In the latest week 1,892 were exported, this included a combination of calves and store cattle for further feeding, and 353 animals for direct slaughter.  
For the first 6 weeks of 2021, live exports of cattle are back by 1% compared to the same period last year. 
14,059 head of cattle are exported to-date with 50% of this to Northern Ireland.  
Due to recent bad weather, livestock have not been able to travel by sea and this has affected the numbers of calves exported. 
CAP  
Livestock farmers depend on Direct Payments for 160% of Family Farm Income 
Payments to active productive beef and suckler farmers must be protected in the new CAP. 
The payments and/or value of payments to active productive suckler and beef farmers must not be eroded in the new CAP policy through reduced efficiencies and productivity imposed in the National Strategic Plans  
Suckler farmers must receive a payment of €300/cow  
New BEEP-S 
The new BEEP-S scheme is set to open in the coming weeks with farmers who produced autumn born calves being advised to weigh animals coming near weaning and take notes of the date and weights which can be inputted into the system when it officially opens.  
BDGP 
IFA called for the cohort of farmers who participated throughout the scheme but did not qualify for payment last year to be provided with the opportunity to join the scheme for 2021. 
BEAM 
IFA met senior DAFM officials on the flexibilities provided by the commission. 
 The key objective must be to ensure these monies are protected. 
A six-month extension to the scheme has been granted to give farmers more time to meet the 5% reduction. 
This offers participants the option to choose the reference period 1st January to 31st December 2021. 
IFA have sought the provision of a rolling 12-month period within these 18 months. 
IFA have sought a further extension to the timeframe. 
Applicants will be required to apply between April and June to avail of the extended period. 
However, if applicants meet the reduction requirement by the end of June for the original reference period this will be automatically accepted as compliance. 
It is advisable that all farmers in the scheme apply for the extension. 
More relevant and detailed monthly updates will be provided by DAFM, including the provision of an on-line calculator on Agfood.ie to project forward. 
The March and subsequent letters will also include a DAFM projected figure for the herd to the end of June. 
IFA have sought the recognition of a TB breakdown during the course of the reference period as Force Majeure and the 5% requirement be removed.  
DAFM have committed to applying the same criteria as is applied in the Nitrates calculation for restricted herds. 
IFA have sought a reduction in the sanctions for participants who fall short of the 5% requirement but have recorded a reduction in their herd.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/mii-claims-on-beef-price-simply-dont-add-up/,2021-03-10,MII Claims on Beef Price Simply Don’t Add Up,"IFA President Tim Cullinan has rejected today’s claims by MII around beef prices.
“At last night’s IFA online Beef meeting, attended by 250 farmers, the fact that the Irish price is now 13c behind the Bord Bia Prime Export Benchmark price was highlighted, which is based on a weighted composite price in our main export markets,” he said.
“Beef prices must push on and reflect the reality of the market place,” he said.
Tim Cullinan said despite the claims of MII, Grant Thornton admitted to the Task Force that it doesn’t have the authority to access the information needed for a full and independent appraisal of the value of beef at all points in the supply chain.
Because of these constraints, the output is based only on the information that participants are willing to provide.
“Minister McConalogue outlined the importance of greater transparency in the supply chain and he must now come forward with the primary legislation that allows the Office of the Food Ombudsman/Regulator source and provide this information independently,” he said.
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said at last night’s meeting farmers expressed disbelief that the EU Commission are attempting to proceed with the Mercosur deal with South American countries.
“It is unbelievable that following Brexit and the added environmental and production controls the EU are imposing on Irish farmers through the CAP that they are looking at allowing more beef into the EU market to further undermine Irish and EU farmers,” he said.
“We will be meeting the Tánaiste and Minister for Trade Leo Varadkar shortly to put the strongest message across that the Irish Government must oppose the deal,” he said.
Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong for beef and are expected to improve, supplies of cattle are tight and factories must return the full value of the market place in increased beef prices.
He said the Easter demand and the returning food service sector in the UK and throughout the EU as vaccines are rolled out will further drive demand for beef. The strong performance of beef in supermarkets is reflecting changes in consumer purchasing habits.
Predictions for the year are of tight supplies of finished cattle in Ireland, the UK and the EU, creating favourable market conditions for Irish beef which must be reflected in prices.
Brendan Golden said prices are strengthening as factories and agents work hard to secure supplies. Steers are making €3.80/kg, heifers €3.85/kg with higher deals for larger and specialist lots. The cow trade also strengthened this week, ranging from €3.00/kg to €3.50/kg with some higher prices paid. Young bulls are making €3.65 to €3.95/kg depending on grade.
Prices in marts for finished and forward store cattle and cows are strong and providing a real competitive alternative for some farmers."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/getting-irish-beef-back-into-the-chinese-market-a-priority-following-bse-risk-status-update/,2021-03-24,Getting Irish Beef Back into the Chinese Market a Priority Following BSE Risk Status Update,"IFA President Tim Cullinan said the Minister for Agriculture and the Govt must now redouble their efforts to secure an immediate return of Irish beef to the Chinese market.
It follows the announcement that Ireland has fulfilled the criteria to attain OIE negligible risk status for BSE.
“It’s a welcome recognition of the work and production standards on Irish farms,” he said.
However, IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the critical issue for farmers is to see a meaningful return from the market place in beef prices.
“This is a positive development for beef sales and there is no justification for our beef prices to continue lagging behind the Prime Export Tracker Price by 13c/kg,” he said.
Brendan Golden said market conditions are favourable and strengthening, and base line prices for cattle must move to a minimum of €4.00/kg to reflect the reality of the market place.
“The short-term concerns of Brexit interruption have been removed.  We are on track to regain our negligible risk status for BSE, the numbers of cattle are extremely tight and supermarket demand is strong,” he said.
He said factories must return meaningful price increases to align our beef price with the market returns.  The starting point is a base of €4.00/kg based on the current Prime Export Tracker price."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/factories-out-of-excuses-as-beef-markets-surge/,2021-03-26,Factories Out of Excuses as Beef Markets Surge,"IFA President Tim Cullinan said there are no excuses left for factories failing to return the value of the market in beef prices.
The UK price has risen by 8c/kg in the past week, driven by supermarket demand; the anticipated re-opening of the food service sector; and extremely tight supplies of cattle.
The latest Prime Export Tracker Price is €3.87/kg, with our price lagging behind by 12c/kg at €3.75/kg.
Tim Cullinan said numbers of cattle here are not meeting demand from the market place and immediate and substantial price rises are justified.
“It’s time to call a halt to the control meat factories have exerted on beef prices over the past number of weeks and make them pay the market returns,” he said.
The value of Irish beef in comparison to our main markets has now moved well past the €4/kg base price and this must be the immediate target.
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the blatant profiteering of meat factories off the back of farmers in a surging beef market must stop.
He said the Minister for Agriculture has a role to ensure Irish farmers get the full market value of their animals.
“There is no point in us hearing about how high our standards are and how many markets we can access when the value of these markets is not returned to farmers,” he said.
Brendan Golden said the uncertainty of Brexit has been removed and the new import controls have been pushed out.
“Factories are offering up to €3.90/kg base price for steers and €3.95/kg for heifers.  Farmers should sell hard as factories need the cattle,” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-price-moves-to-e4-kg-base/,2021-04-09,Beef Price Moves to €4/kg Base,"IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have strengthened a further 5c/kg as we approach the weekend. 
A base price of €4.00/kg is more freely available for heifers and €3.95/kg for steers, with higher prices available for larger lots.
He said the re-opening of the food service sector in the UK next week will increase demand for beef and is a key market outlet for Irish beef.
Brendan Golden said the main market driver currently is the UK market, as the EU Young Bull price is lagging 9c/kg behind our steer price.
“Numbers remain extremely tight both in the UK and Ireland and the opening of additional outlets for beef sales must translate into meaningful price increases for beef farmers,” he said.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said demand for cull cows is strong, with P grades starting at €3.20/kg and moving upwards depending on numbers.  Good quality beef bred cows are making up to €3.70/kg in some factories.
Young Bulls are making €3.90 to €4.00/kg for R/U grades.
Brendan Golden said factory agents are competing strongly in marts for finished cattle, and prices are easily comparing to what factories are offering some farmers."
https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/livestock-council-report-april-2021/,2021-04-14,Livestock Council Report April 2021,"Market Report
Beef Price: Prices continue to edge upwards. Steers are generally making €3.85 to €3.95/kg base price. Heifers are making €3.90 to €4.00/kg with higher deals for larger lots and increased breed bonuses paid. Young Bulls are ranging from €3.75 to €3.95/kg for O/R/U grades. The cow trade strengthened during the week, P grades are making €3.15 to €3.20/kg, O grades €3.30 to €3.40/kg, R/U grades €3.50 to €3.65/kg. 
DAFM Reported Prices w/e 28/03/21: Prices for the last week increased by 2c/kg to €4.04/kg for R3 steers, continuing the trend since w/e 28/02/21 when R3 steer price was €3.95/kg.
Beef Market Tracking: The Prime Irish Composite Price for last week increased by 3c/kg to €3.78 with the Export Benchmark Price increasing by 2c/kg to €3.89/kg
GB Cattle Prices as reported by AHDB: Prices in GB for R3 steers increased by 4p/kg in the latest week bringing the price to £3.98/kg
Sterling: Sterling has continued to strengthen since the beginning of the year reaching 85p/€ this week
The latest Commission reported R3 male cattle prices show Steers in Ireland excl. vat €3.83/kg (€4.04/kg vat incl.) UK Steers €4.58/kg and EU Young Bulls at €3.74/kg.
Latest DAFM Kill figures;
Supplies: Supplies of cattle are predicted to be tight for the year in Ireland and the UK. Bord Bia predict Irish supplies to be back 60,000 to 80,000 head compared to last year. The kill to-date is back almost 60,000hd. UK supplies are predicted to be back 5% for the year.
Market Conditions: Demand is strong from supermarkets where beef sales continue to perform strongly. The expected reopening of the food service sector in the UK from 12th April should increase demand for beef. 
Live Exports
For the week ending March 27th, live cattle exports reached 13,692 head 
For the first 12 weeks of 2021, the number of animals exported is running 3% behind the same period 12 months ago, with 85,703 head of cattle exported.
The intra-community trade of Irish dairy calves was strong again this week, with 11,287 calves exported to Continental Europe. 
Live exports last week were helped by calm sea conditions and large numbers of calves becoming available to live exporters. 
Even with the strong intra community trade seen last week, calf exports have declined by 10% on the same period 12 months ago.
The movement of cattle to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly with 1,933 head traveling north during the week ending March 27th. 
This included a combination of calves and store cattle for further feeding, along with 553 animals for direct slaughter. 
24% of cattle exports so far this year have been to Northern Ireland. 
The live exports of animals to Northern Ireland for direct slaughter is expected to remain strong as prices remain more favourable in NI compared to the south.
Live cattle exports to Northern Ireland are running 98% higher compared to the same time 12 months ago, with over 20,700 head exported so far this year.
Beef Meeting 
Over 250 farmers attended the IFA held online meeting for Beef farmers on 9th March.
The meeting provided beef farmers with a presentation on current market conditions and provided an opportunity for farmers to express their frustration with the current market situation.
The importance of Direct Payments for beef farmers was highlighted 
Beef Task Force
Following the unjustified dropping of quotes by factories and the divergence from the Export Benchmark Price IFA called for the Beef Task Force to be convened immediately and wrote to the chairman of the Task Force.
The Beef Task Force met on the 9th of March 2021.
Grant Thornton informed the Task Force that it does not have the authority to access the information needed to provide a detailed appraisal of the value of Irish beef from the farm to the consumer.
The draft report by Grant Thornton fails to provide the details on the value of Irish beef throughout the chain because of these constraints.
IFA called for Minister McConalogue to immediately advance the establishment of Office of the Food Ombudsman/Regulator and underpin it with primary legislation to provide full transparency in the beef supply chain.
A public consultation is due to be launched to identify the extent of regulatory powers the office will need.
The Minister has committed to enacting this primary legislation before the end of the year.
Suckler Brand
The second meeting of the Suckler Brand development group took place on 26th March.
Development of the Brand proposition should be concluded in the next number of months 
The Brand must promote the production systems on suckler farms and return a premium from the market place for beef originating on these farms.
Brexit
The announcement by the UK Government of the revised timetable for SPS checks and controls removes uncertainty in our key export for the next number of months.
Factories can continue to access the market without the uncertainty of the impact of additional checks and controls that were scheduled for April and July. 
This is a very positive development for beef sales and the clarity must be returned in higher prices to farmers
Beef and suckler farmers must be first in line to have the impacts of Brexit addressed through the Brexit Adjustment Fund.

At a recent meeting with Meat Industry Ireland (MII), IFA called for all meat processors to offer Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) as a method of payment to farmers for cattle and sheep sales. IFA President Tim Cullinan has written to all MII requesting all its members offer the EFT facility to farmers selling animals. “The recent announcement that one of MII’s members will offer EFT is a positive move and we are now requesting that all other processors provide the same facility,” he said. IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said it’s imperative and long overdue that EFT is offered by all meat processors, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of why we need to move forward with this.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said market conditions for sheep meat are favourable, underpinned by strong supermarket performance, tight supplies and reduced volumes of imported lamb in our key markets. Total lamb imports to the EU 27 and the UK from New Zealand are down 23% year on year, with EU 27 down 27% and the UK down 20%. The sales of lamb in supermarkets continues to perform strongly, increasing in volume and value by 12% and 6% respectively for the latest 12-week period. Last week’s kill at just under 48,000 was 3,000 below the corresponding week in 2020, with the total numbers processed this year almost 60,000 below last year’s levels.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/revised-figures-point-to-tighter-cattle-supplies/,2021-04-23,Revised Figures Point to Tighter Cattle Supplies,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the updated cattle supply projection provided by Bord Bia points to tighter supplies of finished cattle for the year.
Brendan Golden said the revised figures predict cattle numbers will be some 120,000 fewer this year compared to 2020.
The projection is based on a number of factors, including the very strong export performance of forward store and finished cattle to NI so far this year.  This trend is expected to continue, where exports to-date are up 117% on last year to 24,513.
“Coupled with the estimated 5% reduction in the UK kill for the year, this points to strong and favourable market conditions for Irish beef which must be maximised by factories here and returned in beef prices to farmers,” he said.
The full re-opening of the food service sector in mid-May in the UK will increase demand for Irish beef in particular, as the favoured supplier to this key market.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said beef prices continue to rise as factories struggle to meet demand.
Steers are making €4.05 to €4.10/kg and heifers €4.10 to €4.20/kg base prices, with higher deals available.
Young Bulls R/U grades are making €4.00 to €4.30/kg. Cull cow demand is very strong, with prices for P grades starting at €3.25/kg and moving upwards depending on numbers. O grades are starting at €3.30/kg, with good quality continental cows making €3.50/kg to €3.70/kg.
“The gap with the Prime Export Tracker Price has closed in the last week, but increasing UK prices and the additional demand from the food service sector there for beef is driving the trade. Farmers should sell hard in favourable market conditions,” he said."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/full-takeover-of-slaney-and-icm-by-abp-further-erodes-competition/,2021-05-06,Full Takeover of Slaney and ICM by ABP Further Erodes Competition,"IFA President Tim Cullinan said the full takeover of Slaney Meats and ICM by ABP is a further erosion of competition in the processing sector.
“This consolidation of the buying power for livestock in the hands of a few has to be addressed by the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and the Consumer Protection and Competition Commission (CPCC),” he said.
It comes five years after a joint venture in which ABP took a 50% share in the businesses.
Tim Cullinan said this latest move renews the urgency for the Minister to implement the primary legislation to provide the office of the Food Regulator with the powers necessary to investigate and enforce at all levels throughout the supply chain.
He said returns to livestock farmers must be maximised from the market place.  In order to achieve this, it’s critical we have full transparency on margins throughout the process.
“The CCPC has continually failed farmers in this area.  The figures speak for themselves: breakeven prices for beef are €4.50/kg, but this is rarely achieved due to a combination of factors including lack of competition in the processing sector; high dependence on large supermarket chains; and the powers they have been allowed establish and the importation to our key markets of sub-standard produce,” he said.
The IFA President said the Beef Task Force has been very frustrating, particularly the failure of Grant Thornton to identify margins along the food chain.
In 2016, an independent report commissioned by the IFA on the joint venture raised serious competition issues for farmers.
The main conclusion of the report was that the primary procurement market for farmers selling cattle in Ireland to the meat factories is characterised by weak competition and the deal is likely to weaken competition even further, through a ‘substantial lessening of competition’ (SLC).
“It was very clear on the competition concerns in the beef sector, the income pressures that exist for livestock producers and the impact that any weakening of competition would have on their livelihoods”.
The Irish beef processing industry is much more concentrated than that in England (which is about the same size as the Irish cattle procurement market), with large processors (slaughtering more than 50,000 head of cattle) accounting for 85% of the kill compared to 50% in England. In contrast, small and medium sized processors account for 43.3% of the kill in England and only 8.9% in Ireland.
On sheep meat, the report pointed out that Slaney/ICM is the largest processor of sheep/lamb meat in the State, with around 40% of the kill.  While ABP does not process sheep/lamb meat in Ireland, it is active in this area in Northern Ireland and in England. "

Market Conditions: Retail continues to perform strongly with increased food sector demand anticipated for the summer months.
Live Exports
For the week ending May 15th, live cattle exports reached 7,993 head.
For the first 5 months of 2021, the number of animals exported is running 6.8% ahead of the same period for 2020, with 154,858 head of cattle exported.
The Irish calf exports YTD figure sits at 113,285, a 0.8% increase on the same period for 2020. 
On a per head basis, Spain has been the most popular destination for Irish cattle exports in 2021. 51,934 have been exported to Spain so far this year which is a 16.4% increase on the same period for 2020.
The movement of cattle to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly with the YTD figure sitting at 32,934 which is a 117.3% increase on the 2020 figures. 
The UK and NI experiencing tight supplies has influenced demand and the exchange rate has made Irish cattle more competitive in NI.
The live exports of animals to Northern Ireland for direct slaughter is expected to remain strong as prices remain more favourable in NI compared to the south.
IFA have raised the issues with live exports to GB with the Minister for Agriculture and senior DAFM officials
Food Regulator 
IFA has long called for greater market transparency at all levels in the food chain, so that margins and profitability of processors and retailers are clearly visible. This move by the Commission is welcomed and must be implemented in Member States.  
In the detailed Submission to the Public Consultation on the Transposition of the EU Directive on UTPs in the Food Supply Chain made by IFA in 2019 the importance of extending the powers of the ‘Food Regulator’ to implement member state requirements under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1746 which applies from 1st January 2021 in relation to transparency and price reporting was set out.
IFA have proposed that the role of this Food Regulator could be expanded to provide the European Commission with the mandatory price reporting required to comply with the transparency legislation.
The Minister has outlined the importance of greater transparency in the supply chain to the Beef Task Force and the primary legislation must ensure the Office of the Food Regulator are resourced and empowered to provide this.
The primary legislation must provide the office of the Food Regulator full investigative and enforcement powers for all aspects of the food production chain from farm to the end consumer which extends to all issues that impact on price.
Starting at the primary level the office must be in a position to quantify production costs on farms, investigate these costs, the factors that influence them including detailed and thorough analysis of all input prices and the factors that influence these.
Brexit
The revised timetable for SPS checks and controls removes uncertainty in our key export for the next number of months.
Factories can continue to access the market without the uncertainty of the impact of additional checks and controls that were scheduled for April and July. 
Beef and suckler farmers must be first in line to have the impacts of Brexit addressed through the Brexit Adjustment Fund.
Mercosur
IFA have highlighted the double standards applied by the commission in this trade deal compared to the standards demanded from Irish and EU beef farmers.
IFA have called on the Irish Government to reject this deal.
Irish beef farmers will be most impacted if this additional sub-standard beef is allowed onto the EU and UK marketplace.
IFA are fighting a strong campaign at EU level to have the deal rejected.
IFA have met the Commissioner for Agriculture and called for this deal to be stopped.
Chinese Market
IFA have called on the Minister for Agriculture and Government to redouble their efforts to secure an immediate return of Irish beef to the Chinese market following the announcement that Ireland has fulfilled the criteria to attained official status from the OIE of negligible risk status for BSE.
CAP
Livestock farmers depend on Direct Payments for 160% of Family Farm Income, this must be recognized in the new CAP
Payments to active productive beef and suckler farmers must be protected 
The payments and/or value of payments to active productive suckler and beef farmers must not be eroded in the new CAP policy through reduced efficiencies and productivity imposed in the National Strategic Plans 
IFA demands for livestock farmers in the CAP
Convergence and its impact on the more productive livestock farmers must be kept to a minimum
Eco Schemes must provide farmers the opportunity to reclaim at a minimum the amount contributed by each farmer reflecting the higher environmental ambition that will be achieved and the increased production costs associated on livestock farms
Suckler farmers must receive a payment of €300/cow
The pilot dairy calf to beef scheme must be extended to include farmers who rear beef animals from the suckler herd including store and finishing farmers
National co-financing must be maximized in Pillar 2
The commitment in the Programme for Government of the €1.5b carbon tax monies must be honoured in full through meaningful Pillar 2 schemes for livestock farmers
New BEEP-S
Applications for the new BEEP-S closed on Mon, April 26th.
BDGP
IFA called for the cohort of farmers who participated throughout the scheme but did not qualify for payment last year to be provided with the opportunity to join the scheme for 2021.
BEAM
A six-month extension to the scheme has been granted to give farmers more time to meet the 5% reduction.
This offers participants the option to choose the reference period 1st January to 31st December 2021.
Applicants will be required to apply between April and June to avail of the extended period.
However, if applicants meet the reduction requirement by the end of June for the original reference period this will be automatically accepted as compliance.
It is advisable that all farmers in the scheme apply for the extension.
IFA have sought the recognition of a TB breakdown during the course of the reference period as Force Majeure and the 5% requirement be removed. 
DAFM committed to applying the same criteria as is applied in the Nitrates calculation for restricted herds but due to audit concerns are not prepared to provide this
All TB restricted farms have their reduction target reduced proportionally to the period of restriction for the farm 
DAFM recognize TB as a Force Majeure, all farmers can make an application to DAFM to have their particular situation recognized
IFA are pursuing a simplified system with clear parameters which maximize the opportunity for all restricted farms to be accepted as Force Majeure and have the 5% requirement removed.
IFA have sought a reduction in the sanctions for participants who fall short of the 5% requirement but have recorded a reduction in their herd."

IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said factories are freely offering €7.60/kg and deals on transport to secure lambs with higher deals available for larger numbers. Cull ewes are making €3.20 to €3.50/kg. Sean Dennehy said supplies of suitable finished lambs are tight and market conditions are strong. Hogget supplies have significantly decreased in recent weeks reducing the number of sheep available for slaughter. He said the kill to-date is running 8% behind last year and with the cold weather slowing lamb finish, the number of suitable lambs available remain low. A total of 1,001,500 sheep have been processed in the first 22 weeks of 2021 which is running 78,855 behind the same period in 2020.

He said market conditions are strong as demand from the food service sector increases for the summer months and more reopening’s take place.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said imports to the EU market from Brazil are expected to be low this year as they focus on trying to fill the demand for beef in the Chinese market.
“This creates a very positive market environment for Irish beef in the key EU market where demand is expected to increase from the food service sector for the summer months,” he said.

Young Bulls are ranging from €4.15/kg to €4.30/kg.
He said demand is strong and numbers are extremely tight as demand from the food service sector improves throughout the EU.
“Young Bull prices have strengthened over the past week, reflecting the stronger EU market for beef.  Cattle supplies are predicted to be extremely tight over the coming months and as the seasonal summer demand increases the volume of sales, factories must maximise returns to farmers in the favourable market conditions,” he said.
He said last week’s kill was 28,804. With the steer and heifer kill back 1,164 and 684, respectively, it highlights the extremely tight supplies of prime cattle available to factories.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the current price cutting by factories of lamb prices is unnecessary and must stop. Factories are paying €6.50 to €6.70/kg today for lambs, which leaves Irish lamb very competitive in our key markets. “The EID al-Adha festival, which runs from the 19th to the 23rd July, will increase demand for lamb and factories will be anxious to secure supplies to fill these orders over the coming weeks,” he said. “Following this boost to the market, breeding sales and store buying will be starting and will add competition and help underpin the trade,” he said. Sean Dennehy said weekly supplies of spring lamb remain below last year’s levels, with last week’s kill recording 6,500 fewer lambs than the corresponding week in 2020. Demand is extremely strong for cull ewes with factories paying up to €3.60/kg. The IFA Sheep Chairman said factories must stand firm in the market place and stop the unnecessary price cutting.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said demand for lamb is expected to improve over the coming weeks. Strong demand for live shipping and buying for the Eid Festival in mid-July is starting in earnest. Following this, breeding sales and store buying will increase competition for lambs. He said factories must stand firm in the market place. Irish lamb as it stands is competitively priced to compete in the market and there is no need or justification for further cuts. The IFA Sheep Committee will be meeting with factories in the coming days to set out farmers’ frustration at the recent attempts to severely undermine the trade and the need to maximise returns to sheep farmers from a favourable market environment. He said factories must take a stand.  “Farmers cannot continue to be expected to absorb higher production costs on the one hand while allowing the large supermarkets determine the price we receive,” he said.

IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef remain strong. He said the trade is underpinned by tight supplies and strong retail performance. Steers are making €4.25-4.35/kg, heifers are making €4.30/4.40/kg, with some deals higher, including flat prices for selective lots. He said the prime Irish composite price continues to edge upwards with last week’s price increasing to €4.16/kg and the prime export benchmark price increasing to €4.06/kg. The IFA Chairman said supplies of suitable cattle are tight and demand from factory agents in marts for all types of finished cattle is strong. Cows are ranging from €3.60-4.00/kg Young Bulls R/U €4.30-4.40/kg. Brendan Golden said farmers should sell hard as factories struggle to meet demand.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said strong market demand and tight supplies of suitable lambs forced factories into increasing prices this week. “Deals of €6.40 to €6.60/kg are being offered. Farmers with suitable lambs are rightly holding out for these and higher prices,” he said. Factories are actively seeking lambs to meet the increased demand for the Eid festival starting on July 20th and have had to increase prices. The trade is helped by increased live export buying and will be further supported following the Eid festival as breeding and store sales commence. Cull ewes are also in strong demand with €3.60/kg available. Farmers should continue to sell hard in these favourable market conditions.

IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef should be favourable for the remainder of the year as markets and buying patterns start to return to more normal activity. Supplies of finished cattle will be tight for the rest of the year with numbers back to-date by over 67,000 head with the annual kill predicted to be back a further 50,000 head by year end to a total of 110 – 120,000 less slaughter cattle available than 2020. Strong performance of the live export trade to Northern Ireland for store and finished cattle, which is expected to continue into the back end, is adding vital competition for farmers and ensuring numbers of finished cattle will be tight up to year end. 42,655 cattle have been exported to NI this year already which is an increase of 13,896 on 2020.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said the outlook for lamb prices is positive. He said significant numbers of lambs were moved in the past few weeks to meet demand for the Eid festival. In addition, he said farmers have moved lambs at lighter weights this year with average carcase weights back .5kg for the year. This has reduced the volume of sheep meat in the market place, a situation replicated in the UK and ensures there will not be a glut of lambs to come out. Breeding sales will be starting and combined with the strong store trade will provide competition to factories for lambs. Farmers should sell hard and continue to move lambs as they become fit to maximise returns.

https://www.ifa.ie/policy-areas/favourable-market-conditions-to-continue-for-beef/,2021-08-03,Favourable Market Conditions To Continue For Beef,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef should be favourable for the remainder of the year as markets and buying patterns return to normal.
Brendan Golden said supplies of finished cattle would be tight for the rest of the year. Numbers are back to date by over 67,000 head, with the annual kill predicted to be back a further 50,000 head by year-end, with a total of 110 – 120,000 fewer slaughter cattle available than 2020.
“The strong performance of the live export trade to Northern Ireland for store and finished cattle, which is expected to continue into the back end of the year, is adding strong competition for farmers and ensuring numbers of finished cattle will be tight up to year-end. Forty-two thousand six hundred and fifty-five cattle have been exported to NI this year, increasing from 13,896 in 2020,” he said.
In the UK market, production is predicted to be back at least 4% for the year by combining reduced numbers and lighter carcase weights at slaughter. Import demand is expected to strengthen over the coming months as the foodservice sector returns to normal trading conditions. Irish beef has a strong foothold in this sector.
EU prices have strengthened over the past week, and overall production for the year is predicted to be down, providing further opportunity for Irish beef exports.
The Chinese demand for protein, redirecting South American beef exports from the EU market, ensures the market is functioning strongly for Irish beef when not undermined by these imports.
Brendan Golden said, “The favourable market conditions in our main export markets are expected to continue for the year. This must be reflected in prices paid to farmers”.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said that while beef prices have increased over the year (the Prime Irish Composite price of €4.22/kg is running 30c/kg ahead of the Prime Export Benchmark price of €3.92/kg), so to have production costs.
He said market conditions are favourable, supplies are tight, and farmers should continue to bargain hard.

Supplies of cattle for the remainder of the year are predicted by Bord Bia to be back up to 40,000 head compared to last year.
In our main market – the UK – supplies are running below last year’s levels by 5%. This is forecast to continue for the year.
He said GB prices have strengthened consistently since mid-May with EU Young Bull prices also edging upwards, highlighting the demand for beef in our main markets.
Brendan Golden said the latest Prime Irish Composite price is €4.23/kg, compared to the EU Prime Export Benchmark price of €4.06/kg, with the Export Benchmark Price increasing by 3c/kg on the week.
“Factories know supplies will be extremely tight for the year. Demand for Irish beef will be strong and prices must reflect this favourable market situation,” he said.
He said despite lower quotes in some factories, steers are making €4.20/kg with heifers making up to €4.25/kg base prices. Demand for Young Bulls is steady with prices ranging from €4.10 to €4.30/kg for R and U grades. Cow prices are steady. P grades are making up to €3.60/kg in most factories with O grades generally coming in at €3.70/kg and R and U grades making €3.80 to €4.00/kg.
“Grass supplies are good, cattle are performing well and cattle should only be moved as they become fit to ensure farmers keep control of the supply/demand balance,” he said."

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said lamb prices have increased by up to 20c/kg this week as factories compete for supplies. He said prices of €6.40/kg are available, with deals to 21.5kgs. Better deals are available for larger lots and groups. Cull ewes are making €3.40 to €3.60/kg. He said store and breeding sales are buoyant in the marts and they’re providing competition for lamb supplies to the factories. He said farmers should sell hard in a strong market, while moving lambs as they become fit. “The orderly selling of lambs this year is ensuring there will be no glut of lambs coming onto the market. The absence of imports from outside the EU in the market place is also a significant contributor to the positive market conditions which should prevail for the year,” he said.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-prices-strengthen-in-key-export-markets-as-supplies-tighten/,2021-08-24,Beef Prices Strengthen in Key Export Markets as Supplies Tighten,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said tight supplies and strong farmer resistance have maintained beef prices this week, with some factories forced into increasing quotes to secure numbers.
He said factories are paying €4.20/kg base price to get steers this week, with up to €4.25/kg available for heifers despite some lower quotes.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said the supply demand balance is very much in farmers’ favour. With grass supplies good, cattle should only be moved as they become fit.
He said prices in our key export markets – the UK and the EU – are strengthening. UK supplies are predicted to be back by 5% for the remainder of the year, which creates a positive market environment.
Supplies of finished cattle are estimated to be back 40,000 head for the remainder of the year compared to 2020.  Factories know this and in a positive export market where reduced volumes of South American beef are available, this places Irish beef in a strong position.
Brendan Golden said farmers should ignore the unjustified negative commentary from some factories and their agents, and sell hard when cattle are fit to move to maintain control of the supply demand balance."

Beef Price: Steers are generally making €4.15 to €4.25/kg base price. Heifers are making €4.20 to €4.30/kg with higher deals for larger lots and increased breed bonuses paid. Young Bulls are ranging from €4.15 to €4.40/kg for R/U grades. Cows are making €3.60 to €4.00/kg.
DAFM Reported Prices w/e 22/08/2021: R3 steer prices for the last week dropped by 5c/kg to €4.41/kg, R3 heifer prices dropped by 5c/kg to €4.44/kg. R3 young bull prices dropped by 7c to €4.22/kg. P+3 grade cows were back 2c/kg, O3 grades were back 1c/kg, R3 grades were up 1c/kg.
Beef Market Tracking: The latest available data shows the Prime Irish Composite Price for to be at by €4.23 with the Export Benchmark Price at €4.06/kg
GB Cattle Prices as reported by AHDB: Prices in GB for R3 steers increased slightly by 0.3p/kg in the latest week bringing the price to £4.15/kg
The latest Commission reported R3 male cattle prices show Steers in Ireland excl. vat €3.99/kg, UK Steers €4.56/kg and EU Young Bulls at €3.78/kg.
Latest DAFM Kill figures; 
Supplies: Supplies for the year to date are back 73,294 on the same period for 2020.
Supply Figures as Reported by DAFM – Week 33 (16.08.2021)
Market Conditions: Market conditions are favorable for Irish beef. Good demand and stable to strengthening prices in our key export markets are underpinning the trade. The reduced volumes of South American imports in our key export markets have created positive market conditions for Irish beef exports as significant volumes of Brazilian beef in particular are being exported to China to meet the demand for protein in that country. Supplies are tight and will continue tight throughout the remainder of the year with Bord Bia predicting up to 40,000 less cattle available for slaughter compared to the same period in 2020, supplies to-date are back over 73,000. UK supplies are running 5% below last years levels and predictions are that these reduced levels of slaughter cattle will continue for the remainder of the year.
Live Exports
For the week ending August 7th, live cattle exports reached 2,051 head.
For the first 31 weeks of 2021, the number of animals exported is running 0.7% behind of the same period for 2020, with 198,518 head of cattle exported.
The Irish calf exports YTD figure sits at 137,000 just behind the same period for 2020 but 27% behind the same period in 2019.
64,000 calves have been exported to Spain so far this year which is a 6% decrease on the same period for 2020.
The movement of cattle to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly with almost a 25% increase on the 2020 figures. 
IFA have raised the issues with live exports to GB with the Minister for Agriculture and senior DAFM officials
CAP
Definitions 
There can be no differentiation between the proposed reintroduced 30% of previously ineligible land and productive land. Farmers must have the right to work the land as they see fit. Eg. Clear scrub, graze, use for Nitrates calculations etc.
The inclusion of up to 30% of all land applied on by the applicant consisting of features that may be beneficial to water protection, climate or biodiversity should be impact assessed in the context of impact on the value of payments. The areas consisting of features that may be beneficial to water protection, climate or biodiversity will vary across all parcels and the max 30% per parcel could unfairly penalise some farmers. Allowing for up to 30% of all land applied on to be considered eligible simplifies the proposal provided there is no significant impact on payment levels or unintended distortion of the land market.
     GAECS
GAEC 4: To avoid loss of grazing land, shelter for animals and the imposition of significant cost on farmers buffer strips must not require fencing off.
GAEC 9: 
The minimum EU Regulatory requirement must be applied
BISS
Convergence must be limited to 85% to protect the viability of beef and suckler farmers
CRISS
The Committee acknowledge that while CRISS has been presented as being beneficial for 80% of beef and suckler farmers, the modelling by the department shows only a minor increase in payment for those who benefit and a major loss for those who will have payments reduced, who are primarily beef farmers.
Eco-schemes
Eco-schemes cuts must be kept to a minimum. Eco-schemes monies are monies farmers currently receive without additional obligations, the amount of monies taken from farmers to establish the Eco-scheme budget must kept to a minimum recognising the already significant ‘green’ ambition within Ireland’s Pillar 2 programmes.
Every farmer must be provided with the opportunity to claim back at a minimum all of the money taken from their entitlement value.
Eco-schemes must be developed to support beef and suckler farmers producing food and reflect the higher costs and reduced efficiencies associated with this higher ambition that is imposed on them from the EU.
Suckler Carbon and Environment Measure
The proposed suckler cow scheme requires a funding commitment annually to return €300/cow for participant farmers with an annual budget of €270m
The current proposal lacks ambition to provide the opportunity for participants to generate €300/cow and must be amended through increased/updated costings and additional practical and beneficial measures for suckler farmers.
The proposal to penalise farmers who increase suckler cow numbers, effectively capping and limiting the national suckler cow herd is not acceptable and must be removed. 
The compulsion to be part of the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme as an eligibility requirement of the scheme must be removed. Quality Assurance is a market requirement which should be rewarded from the market place. It is not appropriate as a requirement for eligibility. Carbon is being measured through other schemes without the requirement to be a member of the QA scheme. 
Reference numbers in the scheme must ensure the level of activity on the farm is accurately captured and new entrants to the sector must be facilitated in building their reference numbers while participating in the scheme.
Cattle rearing and finishing scheme
The IFA Submission on the Presentations given to the CAP Consultative Committee relating to the CSP sought an extension to the Pilot Dairy Calf to Beef Scheme to include meaningful payments to farmers who rear and finish weanlings and stores from suckler farms.  These farmers must be provided with a scheme that returns at least €100 an animal in the Strategic Plans with a budget allocation of €100m annually.
Agri Environmental Scheme
A targeted meaningful agri-environmental scheme that supports suckler and beef farmers must be provided in Pillar 2. 
Mercosur
IFA have highlighted the double standards applied by the commission in this trade deal compared to the standards demanded from Irish and EU beef farmers.
IFA have called on the Irish Government to reject this deal.
Irish beef farmers will be most impacted if this additional sub-standard beef is allowed onto the EU and UK marketplace.
IFA are fighting a strong campaign at EU level to have the deal rejected.
IFA have met the Commissioner for Agriculture and called for this deal to be stopped.
Chinese Market
IFA have called on the Minister for Agriculture and Government to redouble their efforts to secure an immediate return of Irish beef to the Chinese market following the announcement that Ireland has fulfilled the criteria to attained official status from the OIE of negligible risk status for BSE.
BDGP
IFA called for the cohort of farmers who participated throughout the scheme but did not qualify for payment last year to be provided with the opportunity to join the scheme for 2021.
BEAM
A six-month extension to the scheme was granted to give farmers more time to meet the 5% reduction. This offered participants the option to choose the reference period 1st January to 31st December 2021. Applicants had from April to June to apply to avail of the extended period.
However, if applicants met the reduction requirement by the end of June for the original reference period this was automatically accepted as compliance.
IFA advised that all farmers in the scheme apply for the extension.
DAFM have provided the following updated figures:
17,800 met the requirement and are now finished with the scheme
11,000 opted for the extension and still need to meet the reduction
3,600 face a penalty
IFA have sought the recognition of a TB breakdown during the course of the reference period as Force Majeure and the 5% requirement be removed. 
DAFM committed to applying the same criteria as is applied in the Nitrates calculation for restricted herds but due to audit concerns are not prepared to provide this
All TB restricted farms have their reduction target reduced proportionally to the period of restriction for the farm 
DAFM recognize TB as a Force Majeure, all farmers can make an application to DAFM to have their particular situation recognized
IFA are pursuing a simplified system with clear parameters which maximize the opportunity for all restricted farms to be accepted as Force Majeure and have the 5% requirement removed.
IFA have sought a reduction in the sanctions for participants who fall short of the 5% requirement but have recorded a reduction in their herd.
IFA are meeting DAFM to address a number of issues in the scheme including;
The claw-back of monies
The option of using the better of the reference periods
TB situation
The overriding objective from DAFM must be to help farmers hold on to the monies received

IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said “The prime export benchmark price, which reflects the strength of the market conditions in our key beef markets has now passed the Irish price by 2c/kg to rest at €4.12/kg, compared with the Irish price excluding VAT of €4.10/kg”. He said “Cattle numbers are tight and will remain tight for the year bolstered by strong live exports of forward store and slaughter fit cattle to Northern Ireland to date this year”. Brendan Golden said that demand is strong and beef price must push on to maximise returns to farmers from very favourable market conditions”.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said supplies of lambs are extremely tight this week, swinging control back in farmers’ favour. He said factories are struggling to secure lambs.  Agents are very active in mart sales in attempts to secure supplies. Sean Dennehy said factories are freely paying €6.30/kg to 21.5kgs, with higher deals on price and weights offered to close out deals. “Farmers should sell hard in very strong market conditions to maintain control of the trade,” he said. He said farmers should only sell lambs to factories as they become fit.  The very strong store trade is ensuring alternatives for lighter and under finished lambs and it’s keeping the supply-demand balance in favour of farmers. Sean Dennehy said based on all projections, there won’t be an oversupply of lamb for the year and orderly marketing is critical to maximise returns.

IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have remained steady this week as a result of strong farmer resistance to lower quotes. He said factories are paying €4.20-€4.30/kg base price to get steers this week, with up to €4.35/kg available for heifers. Supplies of cattle for the remainder of the year are predicted by Bord Bia to be back up to 40,000 head compared to last year.  Brendan Golden said factories know supplies will be extremely tight for the year. Demand for Irish beef will be strong and prices must reflect this favourable market situation.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said demand for lamb is strong from factories this week. He said market conditions remain strong and the number of suitable lambs available are tight. Last week’s sheep throughput was back 3,012 head from the previous week and overall throughput is running 103,055 head behind the corresponding date in 2020. Factories are paying €6.20kg to €6.35/kg, with higher deals available for groups and larger lots. Weights to 22kg are also available to farmers in factories. Mart trade is performing very strong with finished and store lambs in high demand.  Cull ewes are making from €3.00kg to €3.30kg. He said farmers should sell hard in this positive market environment, while moving lambs as they become fit to maximize returns.

IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have remained strong this week. A base price of €4.20 to €4.30/kg is available for steers and heifers are achieving €4.25 to €4.35/kg with higher prices available for larger lots. The IFA Livestock chairman said it is important that cattle are marketed as they become fit. “Farmers are reminded that if cattle aren’t fit for slaughter, the mart is a real viable option” he said. Factory agents remain very active around mart rings looking for cattle that require a short finish for their own feedlots. “All the market indicators are good, with both retail and food service demand up on 2019 levels” he said.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said tight supply is driving on the lamb trade. “Factory agents have had   difficulty sourcing fit lamb this week which has pushed prices on” he said. €6.25 to €6.40/kg to 22kg is freely available for factory fit lamb. As always, better deals are available for groups and larger lots.
Where farmers are struggling to achieve high prices for lamb, they are reminded that the mart trade is also very strong and an option worth considering. The IFA Sheep Chairman said farmers should move lambs as they become fit, but to sell hard to maximise returns. Ewes are making €3.00 to €3.30kg.

IFA livestock chairman Brendan said the roll over of the suckler cow schemes, BDGP and BEEPs, is welcome in Budget 2022. 
However, the IFA livestock chairman said it is disappointing a pilot cattle rearing and finishing scheme was not provided for 2022 to build towards the provision of a scheme for all cattle rearers and finishers in the new CAP. Brendan said the critical issue now for the 2022 suckler cow schemes is ease of access for farmers to these schemes and the facilitation of farmers who had issues with the schemes in the past for the coming year.

Sheep Update
IFA sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said demand from factories is very strong for lamb this week with prices moving up by over 10c/kg. He said most lambs are now moving at prices of €6.35 to €6.45/kg with €6.50/kg and higher paid for larger lots of suitable lambs. Weights of 23kgs are being talked about and some deals are starting to be done at these levels. Cull ewe demand is not as strong in the factories this week. Sean Dennehy said farmers should continue to move lambs as they become fit while selling hard in a positive and strengthening market for sheep meat.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/market-justifies-beef-price-increase/,2021-10-19,Market Justifies Beef Price Increase,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said favourable and strengthening market conditions should be coming through in higher beef prices.
Brendan Golden said supplies of finished cattle are tight and factories are actively offering various deals to secure numbers while trying to hold back on base price increases.
“The current base prices for steers and heifers of €4.20/kg and €4.25/kg, respectively, are lagging behind market returns and must move on,” he said.
Demand for cull cows is steady, with the P grades still commanding €3.60/kg in some factories and better grading R and U grade cows making up to €4.00/kg
The kill to-date this year is 70,000 down on last year, which means there will be 40,000 fewer cattle available to factories between now and Christmas based on the Bord Bia supply predictions for the year.
UK beef production is currently 4% below last year’s levels, a trend that is forecast to continue for the remainder of the year.  This in turn increases demand for Irish beef in this key market over the coming months.
EU prices have risen by 10c/kg over the past two weeks.  When combined with the strong steady beef prices in the UK, this has now pushed the Prime Export Benchmark price 5c/kg above the prime Irish composite price to €4.16/kg, compared to the Irish price of €4.11/kg.
“These strengthening market conditions must be reflected in price increases from factories. With supplies not matching demand, farmers should sell hard to push prices on,” he said.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said exports to Northern Ireland have experienced a strong increase since the beginning of the year, reaching almost 60,000 head to-date. This is almost 30% higher than the same period in 2020 with this demand expected to continue for the rest of the year offering vital competition for forward store and finished cattle.
He said overall there were 218,360 cattle exported to date this year which represents only a small decline from the 222,456 cattle exported in the same period in 2020.
Brendan Golden said the positive market conditions created by the reduced volumes of South American beef imports in our key markets must be maximised and returned to farmers in higher beef prices.
He said Teagasc has clearly shown the target for beef prices must be €5.00/kg to cover the continuous increase in production costs.  Factories must stand firm with the large retailers to ensure beef prices keep pace with the production cost increases farmers have to endure."

IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the new CAP funding and strategic plans are a sell-out of suckler and beef farmers by Minister Charlie McConalogue. He said, “The design of the strategic plans and the funding levels allocated to Pillar II targeted schemes compound the impact of convergence, CRISS and eco-schemes on the suckler and beef farmers most dependant on direct payments for their family income”. “IFA set out clear demands for a €300 suckler cow payment and €100/animal payment for cattle rearing and finishing farmers to ensure CAP monies directly support Irish beef farmers for producing beef to the highest welfare and environmental standards in the world. The Minister has ignored these proposals.” He said the proposed new suckler cow scheme has left 500,000 cows and 30,000 suckler farmers behind based on the funding allocation and number of participants announced this week.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue’s CAP Strategic Plan will exclude one million ewes from any funding. “The proposed €20m/annum Sheep Improvement Scheme with payments of €12/ewe will only be available to 1.7m ewes. This is even fewer than the number of ewes in the current Sheep Welfare Scheme,” he said. He made this point directly to Minister McConalogue at the IFA protest in Kilkenny on Thursday night and called on the Minister to provide funding for €30 for all ewes in the country in the new CAP plans. “According to the most recent census figures, there are over 2.6m ewes in the country. Using those figures, the proposed funding will only deliver a payment of €7.70/ewe” he said.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/rising-eu-and-uk-markets-must-be-reflected-in-beef-prices/,2021-11-01,Rising EU and UK Markets Must be Reflected in Beef Prices,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices must move on to keep pace with the significant increases in the UK and EU cattle prices.
Brendan Golden said the latest Prime Export Benchmark price is €4.19/kg, which is 9c/kg above the prime Irish composite price of €4.10/kg.
“Beef prices in our key markets have strengthened consistently over the past number of weeks, up 10c/kg, against a background of static Irish prices,” he said.
He said demand for beef is strong and will increase over the coming weeks as supplies continue to tighten.  UK supplies are predicted to be 5% below last year’s levels over this period.
Brendan Golden said the reduced numbers of suitable prime cattle for slaughter in Ireland that is available to factories over the coming months is very evident on the ground.
Based on throughput to-date, Bord Bia predict there will be some 40,000 fewer cattle to slaughter between now and year end.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said farmers should dig in and sell hard as supplies of prime cattle are well short of market demand.  The base prices offered, of €4.20/kg for steers and €4.25/kg for heifers, to most farmers are lagging behind what the market is returning and must push on.
“Attempts by some factories to lower cow prices are unjustified and should be resisted,” he said.
Brendan Golden said farmers are faced with a continual increase in production costs that cannot be avoided and these must be reflected in the beef price.
He said rising production costs must be factored in by the meat factories in supply contracts with supermarkets and returned to farmers in higher cattle prices.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said as a starting point the strength of our key markets must be returned immediately in the higher prices justified by the current market conditions."

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said lamb price continues to rise as factories struggle to match supplies with market demand, increasing by 30c/kg over the week. He said lambs are making €6.70/kg to €6.80/kg today, with weights of 22.5kgs and 23kgs offered. Cull ewes are making €3.00/kg to €3.30/kg in general. He said some lambs bought by factories are coming in at the equivalent of €6.90/kg, with farmers sights now on the €7.00/kg target. “Good quality fleshed lambs are very scarce on the ground and factories are having to compete to secure supplies to meet the strong market demand for sheep meat,” he said. The mart trade has also strengthened for all types of sheep with competition between factory agents, wholesalers and butchers with factory agents also competing for short keep stores to secure numbers.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Committee Chairman Sean Dennehy said market demand for lambs has pushed prices on 40c/kg in the past week. He said at this stage factories are offering €7.40/kg, with deals on weights to 22.5/kgs, and in some cases, 23kgs. Transport is also on offer to secure lambs. Sean Dennehy said higher deals are available for groups and larger lots and the trade will continue to strengthen as supplies fall well short of market demand. Some factories are also offering bonuses of 20c/kg for light lambs up to 15/kgs, in an attempt to increase throughput of lambs. He said competition in marts is intense between butchers, wholesalers, factory agents and store finishers.  This is providing farmers with a real competitive alternative to factories and ensuring the supply demand balance remains firmly in farmers’ favour.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-price-increases-with-room-for-more/,2021-11-15,"Beef Price Increases, With Room for More","IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have started to move upwards as factories struggle to secure supplies.
He said most farmers are now securing €4.20/kg for steers, with prices up to €4.30/kg offered for specialist lots.  Most heifers are now moving at €4.25/kg, with up to €4.35/kg offered at the top end. Cull cows have steadied and are ranging from €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg depending on grade.
Brendan Golden said prices in the UK have strengthened again and supplies are running 4% below 2020 levels, creating strong demand for Irish beef for the lucrative Christmas trade.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said our beef prices are lagging 9c/kg behind the latest Prime Export Benchmark price and must push on.
“Cattle supplies are predicted to be extremely tight up to year end.  Combined with the reduced volumes of beef in the UK and the low levels of South American imports in the EU market, this creates a very positive market environment for Irish beef which must be returned to farmers in strong price increases,” he said.
Brendan Golden said farmers should dig in and sell hard.  “Factories need cattle to fill the lucrative Christmas orders and must return the full value of the current strong market conditions,” he said."

IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the lamb trade continues to strengthen, driven by strong market demand and tight supplies of finished lamb. Factories are paying €7.30/kg to €7.50/kg with higher deals available for groups and larger lots. In addition, transport and weights to 22.5kg and 23kg are on the table to close out deals he said. Strong factory demand is feeding through to mart sales where factory agents, wholesalers and store buyers are competing very strongly for the limited number of lambs available. He said store lambs making from €3.10/kg to €3.50/kg in marts, with hill type lambs coming into €3.00/kg to €3.20/kg. Sean Dennehy said returns from mart sales are comparable to and in some cases above prices factories are offering, providing farmers a real alternative market for their lambs.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-price-increase-not-keeping-pace-with-markets/,2021-11-25,Beef Price Increase not Keeping Pace with Markets,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have moved on by 5c-10c/kg this week, but are still lagging behind the returns from our key export markets where prices continue their strong growth.
This is reflected in the latest Prime Export Benchmark price of €4.24/kg, which is now 13c/kg above our Prime Composite price.
Brendan Golden said since the beginning of October, the Prime Export Benchmark price has increased by 12c/kg to its current levels.  Over the same period, factories have held our prices stagnant which is completely unjustified in the current market.
Supplies of finished cattle are extremely tight, with last week’s kill dropping to 35,652, a drop of 2,000 cattle in the past two weeks.  The steer kill alone was down 1,600 head in the past week.
Based on supply predictions from Bord Bia, which have been very accurate to-date, numbers of finished cattle available to factories over the coming weeks will be limited and farmers should take full advantage to drive prices on.
Brendan Golden said lucrative Christmas orders are being filled by factories as demand for beef heats up in our key markets. 
“Supplies of suitable cattle are extremely tight here and in the UK.  Farmers should dig in and sell hard to push factories into paying the prices justified in the market place,” he said.
“The current prices of €4.20 for steers and €4.25 for heifers are a long way short of the market and must be increased.  Factories are paying up to €4.35/kg for steers and €4.40/kg for heifers for specialist and larger lots.  Young bulls are making €4.15/kg to €4.30/kg.  Culls cows are ranging from €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg,” he said.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said factories must come forward with prices that reflect the reality of the market place and increased production costs as beef farmers experience unsustainable input price inflation."

Supplies: Supplies are currently over 70,000 below last year’s levels to-date. Bord Bia predict the total throughput for the year to be 110,000 below 2021 levels, pointing towards very tight supplies for the remainder of the year with up to 40,000 less cattle available to factories between now and end of the year compared to 2021. UK supplies are running 4.5% below 2021 levels a trend that is predicated to continue for the remainder of the year.
Market Conditions: Market conditions are favorable for Irish beef. Good demand and consistently strengthening prices in our key export markets are underpinning the trade. Demand for beef will increase over the coming weeks as factories fill orders for the lucrative Christmas trade. Market conditions and tight supplies justify price increases. 
Live Exports
For the week ending October 23rd, live cattle exports reached 5,966 head.
For the first 43 weeks of 2021, the number of animals exported is running 5.3% behind of the same period for 2020, with a total of 226,437 head of cattle exported so far in 2021. 
The Irish calf exports YTD figure sits at 139,033 which is 1.6% behind the same period in 2020.
The movement of cattle to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly with over 25% of an increase on the 2020 figures. 
Chinese Market
IFA have called on the Minister for Agriculture and Government to redouble their efforts to secure an immediate return of Irish beef to the Chinese market following the announcement that Ireland has fulfilled the criteria to attained official status from the OIE of negligible risk status for BSE.
CAP
The Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue must honour the commitment given to IFA at the recent mart meetings that he will pay out on every suckler cow that’s applied for in the next CAP in the proposed new suckler scheme.
Following IFA’s rejection of the limit on suckler cows originally proposed in the new sucker cow scheme this requirement has been removed from the latest proposals
Compulsory participation in the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme must be removed from the suckler cow scheme requirements
Payment rates of €150 on the first 10 cows and €120 on all remaining cows in a herd are a significant increase from the current scheme, bringing the average payment up from €85 to €135 per cow for a 25-cow herd, which is the average size of suckler herds currently in the scheme.
IFA set out clear demands for a €300 suckler cow payment and the proposed scheme must be enhanced and commitments on the funding for the National scheme (currently BEEPs) must be forthcoming to bring the payment levels to €300 per suckler cow
IFA is seeking a €100/animal payment for cattle rearing and finishing farmers to ensure CAP monies directly support Irish beef farmers for producing beef to the highest welfare and environmental standards in the world and to off set the impact of convergence, CRISS and Eco Schemes on some of our most productive farms who depend most on direct payments for family farm income (FFI)
These farms are integral to the beef production systems in Ireland, and the proposed Strategic Plans must include a scheme that delivers €100/animal payment for farmers who rear and finish cattle.
Eco schemes must be developed that provide farmers with the opportunity to claim back all of the monies taken from their basic payments
The Eco scheme measures must be practical to implement, be aligned to current good practice on farms, add value to the farm production and cannot increase costs for farmers.
BDGP
DAFM have confirmed that payments will issue in mid-December. 
BEAM
A six-month extension to the scheme was granted to give farmers more time to meet the 5% reduction. This offered participants the option to choose the reference period 1st January to 31st December 2021. Applicants had from April to June to apply to avail of the extended period.
However, if applicants met the reduction requirement by the end of June for the original reference period this was automatically accepted as compliance.
IFA advised that all farmers in the scheme apply for the extension.
DAFM have provided the following updated figures:
17,800 met the requirement and are now finished with the scheme
11,000 opted for the extension and still need to meet the reduction
3,600 face a penalty
IFA have sought the repayment of the monies taken from farmers ANC payments and the provision of an extended period for repayment with no interest charges
IFA have sought the recognition of a TB breakdown during the course of the reference period as Force Majeure and the 5% requirement be removed. 
All TB restricted farms have their reduction target reduced proportionally to the period of restriction for the farm 
IFA have sought a reduction in the sanctions for participants who fall short of the 5% requirement but have recorded a reduction in their herd.
IFA are seeking the provision of the better of the two references periods for farmers who fail to meet the 5% reduction by the end of December.
Beef Carcase Classification
IFA met with DAFM in relation to the upgrading of the mechanical classification technologies which is currently being rolled out in factories across the country. 
Climate Action Plan
The sequestration on livestock farms must be fully accounted for. 
The livestock sector must be provided with the financial supports necessary to reflect our climate ambition.
Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR)
The BAR must be used to off set the losses beef finishers experienced in Spring 2021.
Electronic Payments from factories
IFA have met MII and sought the provision of electronic payments to farmers for cattle (ETF)."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-price-still-lagging-behind-market-returns-ifa/,2021-12-01,Beef Price Still Lagging Behind Market Returns – IFA,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said factories are not reflecting the strength of the market in prices to farmers, even though they went up by another 5c/kg this week.
He said the latest Prime Export Benchmark price has opened up a gap of 17c/kg with the Prime Irish price, reflecting the strength of the market for beef.
Brendan Golden said supplies of prime cattle are extremely tight.  Last week’s kill of steers came in at just over 13,000 head and the heifer kill dropped by over 800 head on the previous week to just over 10,000.
“Factories are paying €4.25/kg for steers and €4.30/kg for heifers freely this week, with up to €4.40/kg paid for steers and €4.45/kg for heifers as they struggle to get suitable cattle,” he said.
Cow prices are ranging from €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg depending on grade with young bulls grading R/U making €4.20/kg to €4.40/kg.
Brendan Golden said there is no justification for prices lagging behind the Prime Export Benchmark Price by 17c/kg and factories must start returning the full value of the current market in beef prices offered to farmers.
“Cracks are appearing in the stranglehold factories have had on prices over the past few weeks.  Farmers should sell hard in what is a very strong market for beef, with supplies not meeting the lucrative Christmas demand,” he said."

Sheep Update
Commenting on the issuing of the advance payments for the 2021 Sheep Welfare Scheme (SWS), IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the new reference periods are worth over €2m more for farmers in the scheme. He said the new reference periods for the scheme provide established flocks with the higher of 2017, or the original 2014/2015 reference years, for payment calculations. New entrants can use 2019 to reflect the process of establishing their flock. Sean Dennehy said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue announced his intentions earlier this year to update the reference periods to better reflect the actual activity levels on sheep farms, following IFA’s calls to bring the reference periods up to date. “The Minister has honoured this commitment and provided the additional funding for this year’s and next year’s SWS, increasing payments to farmers by over €4m over the two-year period,” he said. Sean Dennehy said the focus must now be on building on this Scheme in the new CAP, to bring payments to €30/ewe. He said the current Strategic Plan lacks the funding and ambition to provide this and must be amended.

The average price paid for R3 steers for the first 48 weeks of the year was €4.28/kg which is 46c/kg higher than the same period in 2020. Steer prices are 14% higher than they were in 2020, and 21% above the corresponding week in 2019. Global prices are strong, and across Europe, average R3 young bull prices have seen very strong growth rates in recent weeks. The Prime Irish composite price to-date this year increased by 12.6% on 2020 to €4.00/kg excl. vat, (€4.22/kg vat incl.) The Prime Export Benchmark price increased by 12.9% to €4.00/kg. Total cattle throughput has reached 1,643,719 up to week 50 of 2021. This is a 5% decline on 2020 figures. The overall reduction in supplies of 79,947 is running below the Bord Bia predicted decrease in supplies for the year and indicate the earlier slaughter of some animals which should contribute to tighter supplies in the early part of 2022.

Sheep Update
Lamb prices in 2021 have performed well, with the average lamb price of €7.33/kg, up €1.48/kg on the 2020 average price for the first 48 weeks of the year or a 27% increase. Market demand for lamb in our key export markets has been strong due to the reduced volumes of New Zealand lamb. NZ imports to the EU are at the lowest levels in decades from a combination of focusing on the strong demand in China for sheep meat and shipping issues. Lamb prices in all the key lamb producing countries have remained strong throughout the year. Total throughput to week 50 is 2,639,281 head which is a 4% decrease when compared to the same period in 2020. Stronger lamb throughput in recent weeks has brought the Spring lamb kill to 5,558 above the same period in 2020.

Sheep Update
Reacting to the recent sheep kills reported throughout the country over the Christmas period, IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said Government and the various state agencies with responsibility in this area continue to sit on their hands on the matter. IFA has met with Ministers Charlie McConalogue and Malcolm Noonan on the issue over the past year to have meaningful measures put in place to protect sheep farmers from the irresponsible behaviour of some dog owners. IFA launched a ‘No Dogs Allowed’ campaign in early 2021.  This campaign will continue until action is taken by Government to address this persistent problem. Sean Dennehy said the numbers of dog attacks on sheep is grossly under reported, due to the lack of action from authorities when sheep kills and sheep worrying are reported by farmers. This is unacceptable, government agencies with responsibility in this area must come forward with the necessary sanctions and controls for irresponsible dog owners he said.

IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said cattle prices have increased again this week. The IFA Livestock Chairman said “Factories are anxious for cattle and farmers with stock on hand should sell hard”.  Demand for cows is strong in the mart with factory agents active around the ring. There is strong demand in our key export markets which is predicted to continue for the first half of 2022. The reopening of the food service sector over the coming weeks will increase demand both domestically and in our key export markets.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the market conditions that underpinned the sheep trade for the past two years look set to continue for 2022. “Demand for sheep meat in China will continue to drive the global trade as New Zealand and Australia focus on supplying this lucrative market. Consumption of sheep meat in China has increased by 9% since 2018,” he said. This change in supply pattern has resulted in NZ filling only 46% of their EU quota, which is the lowest in decades.  This is increasing the opportunity for Irish exports. Sean Dennehy said the trade is predicted to hold steady over the coming months with supply and demand balanced, Easter and Ramadan in early April will be key drivers of the trade. Ongoing issues with UK access to the EU market will create openings for Irish lamb. The IFA Sheep Chairman said the relaxation to COVID-19 controls for the food service sector will increase demand for lamb in the domestic markets, and with COVID-19 cases falling, workforce issues will ease.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-prices-continue-to-edge-upwards/,2022-01-31,Beef Prices Continue to Edge Upwards,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices continue to edge upwards on the back of tight supplies and strong factory demand.
He said base prices are starting at €4.30/kg for steers and €4.35/kg for heifers with another 5c to 10c/kg available for larger and specialist lots. R/U grading young bulls are making €4.20/kg to €4.40/kg.
Demand for processing beef is particularly strong, with cow prices ranging from €3.65/kg to €4.10/kg.
“Demand for beef in our key export markets – the UK and the EU – is strong, with the prime export benchmark price showing consistent growth since the beginning of the year. It’s now 3c/kg above our price,” he said.
Brendan Golden said numbers of slaughter fit cattle are tight. With live exports to NI performing strongly for forward store and finished cattle, factories are having to compete for supplies.
He said farmers should sell hard in these positive market conditions to match the price returns in our main markets."
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-adapting-to-climate-action-have-to-be-properly-supported/,2022-02-01,Farmers Adapting to Climate Action Have to be Properly Supported,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the Advantage Beef Programme launched by ABP is an attempt to promote younger age of slaughter for cattle sourced from suckler and dairy herds while also promoting lower levels of antibiotic usage.
He said the programme is clearly seeking to react to the increased societal demands on climate action and antibiotic usage in food production.
Brendan Golden said farmers are acutely aware of these increased demands from society and policy makers, and have openly stated we will play our part.
However, these changes to production systems and management practices do not come without additional costs and the need for time to implement them at farm level, key points which IFA highlighted directly to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture at our AGM last week.
“This type of change at farm level will require direct financial supports from Government for cattle rearing and finishing farms which IFA has consistently called for in the Strategic Plans of the new CAP,” he said.
In relation to the ABP scheme which proposes to pay bonuses on the ‘AQP’ (Average Quoted Price of the seven ABP/Slaney plants) for the week of slaughter, it’s extremely difficult to see how this provides any ‘guarantee of price’ which the company claims.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said security must be provided to beef finishers by all factories of longer-term price contracts/agreements that protect farmers from taking all of the financial risks in finishing cattle.
Brendan Golden also called out the need for the stronger legislation committed to by the Minister for Agriculture for the office of the Food Regulator to be put in place as a matter of urgency in order to provide full transparency for the value at each point in the supply chain.
He said until we have this critical information farmers will continue to be at the mercy of the factories and the prices they decide to quote on a weekly basis."
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/beef-prices-rise-5c-kg-to-10c-kg-but-costs-outstripping-price-increase/,2022-02-08,"Beef Prices Rise 5c/kg to 10c/kg, But Costs Outstripping Price Increase","IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have risen by between 5c and 10c/kg this week as factories struggle to match supplies with demand.
He said base prices for steers are now ranging from €4.35/kg to €4.50/kg.  Heifers are ranging from €4.40/kg to €4.55/kg, with higher prices available for larger and specialist lots.
Young bulls are making €4.25/kg to €4.45/kg for R/U grades. Cows continue to make between €3.65/kg and €4.10/kg depending on grade, with specialist factories at the higher end.
“Increased feed and fertiliser costs on beef farms have eroded the price increases from 2021. Despite beef prices running at 50c/kg above last year, for higher stocked beef farms, feed and fertiliser costs have risen by 65c/kg above 2021 levels, based on Teagasc estimates,” he said.
He said these cost increases are not sustainable.  There is no capacity on low- income beef farms to absorb this unprecedented increase in production costs and they must be picked up through the supply chain.
“Beef farmers have to be protected from this level of volatility.  It’s up to factories to ensure beef prices returned to farmers fully cover these costs,” he said.
Brendan Golden said demand for beef is strong with live export demand for forward store and finished cattle from Northern Ireland providing real competition and underpinning the trade.
He said the supply demand balance in our key export markets, the UK and the EU, is very much in our favour with reduced volumes of South American imports available. Brendan Golden said factories must take full advantage of these conditions to maximise beef price returns to farmers. The IFA Livestock Chairman said factories are actively seeking cattle and farmers should sell hard to maintain the upward momentum in beef prices."

IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said demand for beef is strong as prices continue to increase, rising a further 5c/kg. He said factories are offering deals on transport and flat deals to secure numbers. €4.40/kg base price is available in most factories for steers, with €4.45/kg the starting point for heifers with all factories paying 5 to 10c/kg above quotes to secure numbers pushing paid prices to €4.50 and €4.60/g respectively with higher deals for specialist and larger lots. Young bulls are ranging from €4.30/kg to €4.50/kg for R/U grades with flat prices of €4.45/kg. Cows are making €3.70/kg to €4.10/kg. Brendan Golden said farmers should sell hard, demand for beef in our key export markets is strong and supplies of suitable cattle are tight with mart prices for cull cows and finished cattle well above factory prices in cases and providing real competition for farmers. He said all in prices of €5/kg are now very much in play and needed as production costs look set to be 65c/kg above last year’s levels.

Sheep Update
IFA sheep committee chairman Kevin Comiskey said factory cuts for overweight and underweight lambs are unjustified. He said the trade is strong for sheep meat and factories should be working with farmers, not against them. The IFA sheep committee chairman said most lambs continue to move between €6.90/kg and €7.00/kg, cull ewes are in strong demand with prices in general from €3.30/kg to €3.60/kg. Kevin Comiskey said the mart trade continues to be a viable alternative and where there is good competition between factory agents and butchers prices are at the higher end of the scale. He said it is important farmers sell lambs when fit to maintain control of the supply situation and maximise returns. The IFA sheep committee chairman said sheep farmers are facing cost increases for the year of between €10 and €12/ewe on fertiliser alone based Teagasc estimates and there is no capacity on sheep farms to absorb these increases, they must be returned from the market place.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-prices-strong-but-input-cost-surge-hits-margins/,2022-02-17,"Beef Prices Strong, But Input Cost Surge Hits Margins","IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said demand for beef in our key export markets is extremely strong.
“Cattle supplies in the UK since the start of the year are running 10% below last year’s levels, providing a real opportunity for factories to increase prices to farmers,” he said.
The Prime Export Benchmark Price has surged over the past few weeks and is now 4c/kg above our price, indicating the strength of demand for beef in both the UK and EU markets.
Beef prices have risen again this week, with steers now starting at a base price of €4.40/kg in most factories and heifers starting at €4.45/kg.  Factories are paying 5c to 10c/kg above quotes to secure cattle. This is pushing prices to €4.50/kg and €4.55/kg respectively.
Demand for cull cows is strong, based on the demand for manufacturing beef, with cull cows starting at €3.70/kg for P grades and pushing to €4.20/kg for good quality R/U grades, O grading cows in general are ranging from €€3.80/kg to €4.00/kg. R/U grading young bulls are making from €4.30/kg to €4.45/kg.
All in, prices for some cattle have brought €5/kg very much into play and this must be the target.
“While cattle prices are stronger than last year, the reality is production cost increases have eroded all of these gains.  Based on Teagasc estimates, on some beef farms, fertiliser and feed costs alone are increasing production costs by 65c/kg,” he said.
Brendan Golden said beef farmers are not in a position to absorb these cost increases.  Factories must return the full value of the strengthening beef market to farmers in price increases.
He said farmers should sell hard.  Supplies are tight in our key markets, demand for beef is strong and factory agents are very active on the ground in trying to source cattle.
Brendan Golden said this demand is feeding into mart sales, with prices for finished and forward store cattle and cows very competitive compared to prices offered by some factories."

Prices in the UK are steady with EU young bull prices rising over the past few weeks. 
He said factory agents are very active on the ground and offering deals 10c to 15c/kg above quotes to secure supplies. 
Brendan Golden said beef prices must continue to push on to of set the increased production costs on farms, farmers should shop around and sell hard as prices continue to rise in a very strong market for beef. 
He said mart prices for forward store and finished cattle and cows is extremely strong and providing a real competitive alternative for farmers unable to secure the higher end of factory prices.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep committee chairman Kevin Comiskey said the sheep trade is steady with supplies and demand well balanced which has provided stability on price.
He said selling hoggets only when fit is vital to maximise returns and avoid penalties by factories.
Mart sales are providing real competition to trade with hoggets and in particular cull ewes a stronger trade than what some factories are offering.
The IFA sheep chairman said prospects are good for sheep meat demand for the year and with the increased costs sheep farmers will incur the positive market conditions must come through in price to farmers.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/beef-prices-strengthen-ifa/,2022-02-21,Beef Prices Strengthen – IFA,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have increased a further 5c/kg this week.
He said base prices for steers are ranging from €4.45/kg to €4.55/kg, heifers €4.50/kg to €4.60/kg with higher deals for larger lots of in-spec cattle particularly.
Cow prices have also increased reflecting the strong demand for manufacturing beef, P grades are starting at €3.70/kg with good quality beef bred cows making €4.20/kg. Young Bulls are R/U grades are making €4.40/kg to €4.60/kg.
“Beef prices in our main export markets, the UK and EU, are strong. The increased activity in the UK food service sector is driving demand for processed beef in particular and with reduced production forecasted for the EU, it creates positive market conditions for Irish beef,” Brendan Golden said.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said factories must maintain the upward trajectory of beef prices to offset the enormous cost increases that beef farmers are faced with this year, estimated by Teagasc to be 65c/kg on some farms.
“Farmers should shop around and sell hard as factories actively compete for supplies,” he added."

IFA livestock chairman Brendan Golden said tight supplies and strong demand for beef in our key markets justifies further beef price increases. He said supplies in the UK are running 12% below last year’s levels and prices have increased again in the past week. The latest prime export benchmark price has moved to 5c/kg above our price with the EU composite benchmark price surging to 11c/kg above our price on latest reports. Brendan Golden said this is a clear indication of the strength of demand for beef and critically justifies higher beef prices. He said factories must move to return the full value of current markets to beef farmers and of set the increased production costs beef farmers are exposed to. He said some factories are persisting in offering quotes 10 to 15c/kg below what they are prepared to pay for cattle. The IFA livestock chairman said farmers should shop around and sell hard in a rising market while considering the mart outlet where prices for forward store and finished cattle and cows continue to compete with and surpass what some factories are offering.

IFA sheep committee chairman Kevin Comiskey said hogget prices in the UK have strengthened over the past week as supplies dropped 11%. Demand for hoggets and in particular cull ewes is strong. Kevin Comiskey said tightening supplies of suitable hoggets has increased competition between factories and agents are competing strongly in marts. He said market conditions for sheep meat are favourable and further price increases are justified from factories. The IFA sheep committee chairman said prices in marts are a clear indication of what factories are willing to pay and farmers with suitable hoggets and cull ewes who are not offered the higher factory prices should consider the mart outlet. He said farmers should continue to sell hard in positive market conditions.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-has-to-resolve-beam-issues-for-farmers/,2022-03-07,Minister has to Resolve BEAM Issues for Farmers,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue must move immediately to resolve the BEAM scheme issues for farmers.
He was commenting following a meeting with senior DAFM officials.
Brendan Golden said it’s a clear failure of the BEAM scheme and its administration that 11,000 farmers have, or will have, €18m clawed back from them, primarily as a result of poor scheme design.
Figures show at the end of the latest reference period in the region of 7,500 more farmers have not met the 5% requirement and are liable to have another almost €13m clawed back. This follows the clawback of over €5m from over 3,500 farmers last year.
Brendan Golden said it’s inconceivable that the Minister for Agriculture would allow his officials issue letters to suckler and beef farmers in the coming days demanding the repayment of these monies with the threat of interest charges.
“Suckler and beef farmers have seen the value of current beef prices completely eroded by production cost increases. This situation has been further compounded by the war in Ukraine. We have had further input cost inflation and the new concern of availability for some of our key inputs,” he said.
Brendan Golden called on the Minister to act as a matter of urgency to address this issue once and for all.
“The Minister must provide extended repayment facilities for farmers, with no interest charges,” he said.
Brendan Golden said we can see now the full extent of the money being taken from the pockets of suckler and beef farmers. This must be committed as part of further funding for targeted schemes for suckler cows and cattle rearing and finishing farmers.
He said payments for suckler cows must be increased to €300/cow and a cattle rearing and finishing scheme that returns €100/animal must be put in place.  These monies taken from farmers will require additional funding for these schemes.
Brendan Golden said the Minister and his officials have had over six months to put in place structures to minimise the impact on farmers. IFA has consistently highlighted these issues to them.
He said all farmers who opted to defer in the scheme must be allowed use whichever reference period works best for them, and Force Majeure cases must be fairly dealt with."

The six-month extension to the scheme granted to farmers to meet the 5% reduction ended on 31st December. 
IFA have sought the provision of an extended period for repayment with no interest charges for farmers unable to meet the reduction requirement
All TB restricted farms have their reduction target reduced proportionally to the period of restriction for the farm 
IFA have sought the recognition of a TB breakdown during the course of the reference period as Force Majeure and the 5% requirement to be removed. 
IFA have sought a reduction in the sanctions for participants who fall short of the 5% requirement but have recorded a reduction in their herd.
IFA are seeking the provision of the better of the two references periods for farmers who failed to meet the 5% reduction by the end of December.
IFA are meeting DAFM on the issue.
CAP
The Minister for Agriculture must confirm his funding intentions for the national suckler cow scheme to run alongside the CAP Pillar 2 Suckler cow scheme. 
The funding allocation to sucklers for 2023 is €28m below current support levels.
The Minister has committed that all cows applied on in the new CAP Suckler Scheme will be paid at €150/cow for the first 10 and €120/cow for the remainder, this will require an increase in the €52m annual funding provided.
€300/cow must be provided in targeted support to suckler farmers from 2023 onwards.
The Minister must provide a rearing and finishing scheme for cattle farmers that will return €100/animal to support farmers in meeting the higher environmental production requirements
Climate Action
The sequestration on livestock farms must be fully accounted for. 
The livestock sector must be provided with the financial supports necessary to reflect our climate ambition
The proposed NAP is exposing lower stocked suckler and beef farmers to unnecessary additional costs of compliance in areas such as LESS and outwintering
The reduced thresholds at which this measures become applicable impacts directly on low stocked suckler and beef farms who are not in a position to incur the additional costs associated with these unnecessary changes

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Kevin Comiskey said hogget prices have increased 20c/kg in the past week as factories compete for supplies. Factories are paying €7.00/kg to 7.20/kg for hoggets, with higher prices available to close out deals. The cull ewe trade has also improved, with prices ranging from €3.50/kg to €3.80/kg. He said strong factory demand is feeding through to mart sales where prices are comparable to and above what factories are paying in some cases. 
Cull ewes in particular are in very high demand. The IFA Sheep Chairman said demand for hoggets will strengthen in the coming weeks in the lead up to Ramadan and Easter. Combined with the strong market performance of lamb, this must be reflected in prices paid to farmers. Kevin Comiskey said farmers should bargain hard in this positive market environment while moving hoggets as they become fit.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/measures-needed-to-avoid-disruption-on-beef-and-suckler-farms/,2022-03-25,Measures Needed to Avoid Disruption on Beef and Suckler Farms,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said livestock farmers are already seeing the impact of the inputs crisis at the marts, where lack of confidence and uncertainty has seen prices for lighter store cattle drop over the past week.
He said measures put forward Fodder and Food Security Committee must focus on supporting suckler and beef farmers.
“Incentives to grow extra tillage are important, but the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue must ensure these measures, and those to grow extra fodder, don’t displace cattle rearing and finishing systems,” he said.
He said the trading of animals is a critical component of the livestock sector and the removal of grassland from this system, either through planting of crops or redirecting grass to other sectors, can have very serious consequences.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said immediate and direct financial supports must be provided to farmers to offset the increased costs for feed, fertiliser and fuel on suckler, cattle rearing and finishing farms.
“These supports must be paid directly to farmers based on their level of production,” he said.
Brendan Golden said it’s vital that cattle continue to be finished in line with our well-established production systems. These have delivered a consistent year-round supply of beef and have been fundamental to securing key export markets.
“We are already seeing farmers stepping back from purchasing lighter stores and weanlings as the uncertainty and costs build,” he said.
“There is a real concern the trade of beef animals will be severely disrupted and in turn our supply chain for beef if there is a failure to put guarantees in place for farmers who are producing beef for this Autumn and next Spring,” he said.
The IFA Livestock Chairman also identified availability of key inputs and restrictions on land use under schemes, nitrates requirements and other legal obligations that must be removed to ensure farmers have all lands at their disposal to produce grass.
These include areas such as Wild Bird cover, traditional hay meadows and low input grasslands in the GLAS scheme and the removal of nitrates impediments, including derogation farmers and hedge cutting where necessary to maximise planting areas."

IFA livestock chairman Brendan Golden said prices in our key export markets continue to push on. Beef prices in the UK have increased by between 7c/kg and 12c/kg in the latest week reflecting the strength of demand for beef. He said cattle prices here continue to edge upwards as factories actively seek out cattle fit for slaughter with particularly strong demand for cows continuing. Brendan Golden said competition between factory agents for forward store and finished cattle and cows in the marts is giving a clear indication of prices that are available from factories when pushed. He said there can be up to 10c/kg of a difference in quoted and paid prices in and between factories and it is crucial farmers sell hard to continue the upward momentum in price and close the gap with prices in our key markets.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep committee chairman Kevin Comiskey said Ramadan and Easter demand for sheep meat is driving the trade. Despite factories attempts to hold back on significant price increases extremely tight supplies and strong farmer resistance to lower offered prices is forcing their hand.
Kevin Comiskey said hogget prices in NI and GB increased again over the past week.
He said the trade and the numbers of hoggets and cull ewes available justify stronger prices and farmers should keep an eye on mart sales where factory agents are paying more than what some factories are offering.
The IFA sheep chairman advised farmers to sell hard while moving hoggets that are fit.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/suckler-and-beef-farmers-must-be-supported-at-critical-time-for-sector/,2022-03-30,Suckler and Beef Farmers Must be Supported at Critical Time for Sector,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said we are at a critical time of year for suckler and beef farmers, where key decisions will determine the supply of beef for the next three years.
“These decisions require a commitment from the suckler farmer to maintain the cow until she has reared the calf to weaning in the back end of 2023, which is 18 months away. The uncertainty around availability and costs of inputs such as feed, fertiliser and fuel will play a huge role in this decision making,” he said.
Brendan Golden said the sector does not have the capacity to absorb the level of cost increases across all the key inputs that show no signs of abating.
He said the sector must be supported directly as a matter of urgency to allow farmers plan the breeding season with confidence and ensure we do not lose any more critical mass in suckler cow numbers from the country.
“The lack of confidence in beef finishers for later this year and into next year is clearly evident in mart sales of lighter animals over the past two weeks. Prices for lighter stores have dropped as finishers react to the increased production costs and uncertainty for the year ahead,” he said.
Brendan Golden said contracted/guaranteed prices from factories for this Autumn and next Spring are needed, combined with direct financial supports to farmers rearing and finishing cattle for the back end of this year and early next year.
He said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue must come forward immediately with a financial package for suckler farmers and cattle finishers from the €48m fund to allow key breeding and management decisions be taken that will maintain our supply chain of the highest quality beef in this critical time of food insecurity.
The monies clawed back from BEAM payments of suckler and beef farmers must also be returned to the sectors it was taken from as part of a package of targeted payments.
Brendan Golden was commenting following a COPA-COGECA of the Beef and Veal Group where similar concerns were raised for beef production across other member states.
He said the failure of EU policy in providing food security for the citizens of the EU and to support farmers in producing this food has been laid bare in this recent crisis.
The IFA Livestock Chairman said beef farmers throughout Europe are experiencing the very same difficulties as us in terms of production cost increases, but are more exposed on grain shortages than our grass-based system."

Engagement Continuing on Proposal to Secure Future of Pig Sector
IFA met the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue this week to discuss the proposal to secure the future of the pig sector. The Minister attended Tuesday’s protest and spoke with the IFA President Tim Cullinan, the Chair of the IFA Pigs Committee Roy Gallie and pig farmers. 
Tim Cullinan said the sector’s entire future hangs in the balance and there has to be urgent Government action to support pig farmers.
“We are staring into the abyss here. Our pig sector is an important part of agriculture in this country, contributing nearly €1bn in exports. However, the sector cannot survive a projected loss of €160m in 2022,” he said.
Roy Gallie said the situation could not be more stark.  “We are caught in a devastating price/cost squeeze. Some farmers have already culled breeding sows and more are suspending production. They cannot produce with losses of over €50 per pig, and rising.”
“If the Government wants a pig sector, it must act now. We are at the point where farmers are exiting. If more go, then the upstream and downstream businesses become unviable and then the sector will be gone. It is that serious,” he said.
Immediate Pig Price Increase Needed to Offset Record Losses
IFA National Pigs Committee Chair Roy Gallie is calling on processors to deliver a very significant price increase for pig farmers tomorrow.
“Pig farmers have been haemorrhaging money since September 2021 and losses have risen to €40 per pig sold,” he said.
Since the introduction of the IFA’s DNA scheme, the Irish pig price has been at the European average.
“We are currently 30c/kg below it. Farmers need an immediate price increase given the very serious crisis in the sector,” he said.
Cashflows now are unsustainable. This is an extremely urgent situation. Roy Gallie is calling on all processors to announce a 30c/kg rise tomorrow to restore the Irish pig market to the European average level.

IFA Grain Chairman Welcomes Clarity on new Tillage Scheme
IFA National Grain Chairman Kieran McEvoy has welcomed the official launch of the €10m Tillage Incentive Scheme by the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue. He said the provision of funds towards the increased production of tillage crops in this country was much needed and long overdue. He also welcomed the fact that there was no provision in the scheme to apply a linear cut if the scheme is oversubscribed.
“It’s important that the Minister includes everybody who answers the call to plant more crops. With the unseasonably warm temperatures in March, land has dried out well across the country and we would encourage farmers to consider planting tillage crops under the terms and conditions of this scheme,” Kieran McEvoy said.

IFA Sheep Chairman Kevin Comiskey said hogget and cull ewe prices have risen again this week, but they have not kept pace with the cost increases incurred by sheep farmers. He said market demand is strong for sheep meat with the start of Ramadan and Easter approaching. Supplies are tight and factories have had to move prices on.
Deals to €7.50/kg and above are available at this stage, with no talk of weight cuts as factories try to close out deals. Cull ewes are making up to €4.00/kg. The limited numbers of spring lamb on offer are coming in at €8.00/kg in general, with some deals above this.

Grain Market Update 
Grain prices dropped to the lowest position in four weeks on Tuesday March 29th but have recovered some ground in the days since (AHDB). Glanbia green feed prices fell €3/t this week for wheat and barley. Markets continue to be very receptive to the war in Ukraine and especially to news of any peace talks.
News from the USDA on planting intentions saw markets recover. US farmers are projected to sow 4% less maize in 2022 and replace this with a record area of soybeans. With reduced production expected in Ukraine, North American maize crops are critical in setting the tone for global maize supply and availability (AHDB).

Brendan Golden said market conditions justify a significant increase in beef price and he advised farmers to sell hard. There’s up to 15c/kg of a difference between quotes and what factories are prepared to pay when pushed.

Sheep Market Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Kevin Comiskey said factory demand for sheep meat is extremely strong driven by Ramadan and Easter. He said factory agents are very active in the marts for hoggets and cull ewes.
Kevin Comiskey said numbers of spring lamb remain tight. He said market demand is outstripping supplies and further strengthening in prices is warranted to fully reflect market conditions.

Potato Market Update
Consumption has improved slightly over the past two weeks, however; it is still behind last year when lockdown measures were in place. This is particularly evident for native varieties. Growers have continued plantings this week as ground conditions have improved drastically following the latest burst of dry weather. 
It is reported that many growers will be forced to cut back on planted acreage of 2022 crops due to input costs. Growers currently storing potatoes are experiencing significant costs due to the rise in energy, these spiralling costs must be recognised and paid for by potato packers and retailers.

Pig Market Update
Irish pig prices seen slight increases in the larger ROI plants this week with farmers. Some processing plants have increased quoted prices by up to 20c/kg which is certainly a step in the right direction for those farmers, but with input costs continuing to spiral out of control, farmers require substantially larger increases on the price they receive for their pigmeat to help slow the unsustainable rate at which farmers are losing money.

Beef farmers across Europe continue to engage with the BovINE network via national and international meetings, and exchanges with the project’s national Network Managers (NMs) to express and share their needs for information, tools, and practical guidance to help secure sustainable improvements in their practice and business operations.
The result of that engagement is the selection of eight new Priority Topics for BovINE to concentrate on during 2022, two topics for each of the project’s four thematic areas:
Socio-economic Resilience
Animal Health & Welfare
Production Efficiency & Meat Quality
Environmental Sustainability

BovINE’s four Technical Working Groups (TWGs) one for each thematic area, led by researchers from agricultural research institutions supported by experts and NMs from Farmer Associations, will identify existing literature, policy recommendations and on-farm good practices to produce solutions for these grass roots needs expressed by farmers.
“Here in Ireland, we had a very good National Network meeting hosted by the Irish Farmers Association and Teagasc,” says Kevin Kinsella, the Bovine Irish Network Manager. “Our beef farmers welcomed the opportunity to share their views and highlight their needs for information, guidance and good practices to support their journey towards sustainability.”
BovINE’s 2022 Priority Topics range from securing a fairer distribution of the price paid along the beef supply chain, to the use of alternative feedstuffs in order to reduce the high costs of raw materials; from ‘on farm’ health checks of young stock prior to purchase or sale, to training in animal welfare for operators and farmers to reduce stress; from identifying and validating tools for calculating and improving environmental sustainability and biodiversity on beef cattle farms, to tools and strategies to improve meat quality.
“The TWGs will work to identify existing evidence and guidance on the new priority topics,” says Richard Lynch of Teagasc, the Bovine Project Manager, “and where possible arrange practical demonstrations on local beef farms to create ‘farm ready’ good practices.”
The BovINE network in Ireland will be hearing further from farmers and sharing good practices and new information with them at their National Network meeting to be held in person/hybrid/on line in autumn 2022. To receive up to date information on the national meeting, contact Kevin Kinsella via kevin@agspace.ie 
“All beef farmers, their advisors, business and veterinary services are able to access the wide range and growing number of good practices and information already collated by the BovINE network via the BovINE Knowledge Hub (BKH) accessed here https://hub.bovine-eu.net,” adds Kevin Kinsella.

BovINE continues the work of exchanging knowledge and experience with the European beef farming community and value chain with its whole project Transnational Meeting to be held late 2022. To stay up to date with project news, access the BovINE website (www.bovine-eu.net) where you can also sign up for the project’s newsletter."

Egg producers held a protest outside Annalitten Eggs in Monaghan this week to secure a price increase given to suppliers that hasn’t been passed back to farmers. IFA National Poultry Committee Vice Chair Brendan Soden said the supply chain, in which the primary producer is key, is broken.
“Farmers acknowledge that most supermarkets have listened to their concerns and have passed back increases to their suppliers, which in turn should be passed onto farmers. However, this hasn’t happened,” he said. This situation is very difficult for farmers who have been highlighting since November their need for 2c per egg and 15c per chicken to recover costs.

On Monday, Director of European Affairs Liam MacHale attended the COPA Working Group meeting on pigmeat where German farmers stated the need for a price of at least €2.00/kg and that there was a lag between the price rise in pigs and the rise of meat prices in the supermarket. The price has increased +45% in 6 weeks in Austria to €1.96/kg. It was reported that China is now buying up strategic stocks of pigmeat. Hungary is addressing ASF with a wild boar programme with significant reductions in wild boar numbers in Eastern Hungary. A vaccine for wild boars is needed to eradicate ASF globally.

Latest Market Reports
Beef Market Report
IFA livestock chairman Brendan Golden said demand for beef is extremely strong with UK and EU prices rising sharply in the past week. He said while our prices have risen again this week the weekly 5c/kg increases are leaving our prices lagging behind what is available from the market place in our key markets. He said prices are currently the equivalent of 50c/kg behind UK prices and 22c/kg below the prime export benchmark price.
Brendan Golden said input inflation has eroded virtually all of the price gains from this time last year and prices must push on to cover the enormous cost challenges beef farmers are exposed to. He said factories are not leaving any cattle behind and are prepared to do deals significantly above quoted prices to secure supplies. Brendan Golden said farmers should sell hard in a strengthening beef market where prices in our key export markets clearly show opportunity for stronger price returns to farmers.

Sheep Market Update
IFA Sheep committee chairman Kevin Comiskey said hogget prices have edged upwards again this week but are still trending below this time last year. He said sheep farmers are feeling the brunt of the current input cost inflation and none of this is reflected in the current prices offered. The IFA sheep chairman said sheep farmers are facing into potential cost increases of upwards of €40/ewe while prices remain below last year’s levels.
He said sheep meat prices in the UK and EU are on an upward trajectory with particularly strong increases in UK prices over the past week. Kevin Comiskey said hogget and lamb prices must reflect the additional costs on sheep farms and factories must move to return these additional costs in prices paid to farmers, he said price movements in the UK and EU markets is a clear indication of demand in the market place. The IFA sheep Chairman said demand for lamb is at peak with Easter and Ramadan and this must be returned in higher prices to farmers.
Pig Market Update
Irish pig prices increased by 20c/kg this week with farmers receiving quotes of €1.60c/kg up to €1.64 or €1.66 – €1.70/kg. This is the first upward price movement Irish pig farmers have received since mid-2021 while their input costs have increased to unprecedented levels.
This month is no different in the context of increased inputs.  Farmers have received notification from feed mills of an increase of circa €40/tonne for pig feed from the 1st of April. This increase almost entirely consumes the increase in the pig price which was confirmed on Friday last as quoted above.

Potato Market Update
Markets remain largely unchanged at present and are reported to be subdued, especially in comparison to trade experienced during the pandemic. Energy costs remain to the fore for potato growers with stocks in storage. This, coupled with production costs for the 2022 season, is causing many growers to reconsider their plantings. Many growers may be forced to cut back on planted acreage as a result. These spiralling costs must be recognised and paid for by potato packers and retailers.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/suckler-and-cattle-farmers-most-exposed-by-inputs-increases/,2022-04-13,Suckler and Cattle Farmers Most Exposed by Inputs Increases,"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the updated Outlook for 2022 published by Teagasc today clearly sets out the challenges for the suckler and beef sector and the urgent need for immediate action from the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue to support farmers in our most vulnerable sectors.
Suckler and beef farms are facing a significant drop in income this year which will have severe implications for the sector if urgent supports are not provided.
“Production costs on suckler and finishing farms are projected to increase by 24% and 30% respectively,” Brendan Golden said.
The report finds costs will outstrip any price increase.  Farmers are already seeing this on the ground as beef prices fail to keep pace with input inflation.
“The low income suckler and beef sector does not have the capacity to absorb this level of disruption. The Minister for Agriculture must come forward with immediate direct supports and commitments for the sector to off-set these production cost increases and uncertainties to allow suckler and beef farmers plan with confidence for this year and into the future,” he said.
BEAM monies clawed back from suckler and beef farmers must be utilised as part of the direct financial support package for suckler and beef farmers.
The Brexit Adjustment Reserve and the Crisis Fund must be utilised and targeted directly to suckler and beef farmers who are the most exposed to the impacts of Brexit.
The livestock sector is a low-income sector dependent on direct payments for 160% of FFI.  Recent developments place even more significance on the value of these supports and bring the flawed CAP policy sharply into focus where our most productive suckler and beef farmers will see their payments slashed in 2023 if not amended.
“Suckler and beef farmers have already felt the impact of sterling volatility following the Brexit vote and market disruption from stockpiling of products in December 2020 which led to beef price drops in early 2021,” he said.
Brendan Golden also said meat factories must return the full value of the current buoyant beef trade in prices, there is no justification for our beef price stagnation when prices in our key export markets continue to surge ahead. Meat factories must also come forward with commitments to cattle finishers on price for this Autumn and into 2023.
“It is critical suckler and beef farmers are given a clear signal of short, medium and longer-term support to continue to produce beef at the highest animal welfare and environmental standards,” he concluded."

IFA Reaction to Govt Support Package for Pig Sector
IFA President Tim Cullinan has acknowledged the support from Government for pig farmers, with a package of €13m in funding announced. The IFA President said IFA will be assessing the details of the package brought forward. He said it would be important that there is no unrealistic conditionality attached to the scheme.
Tim Cullinan said any attempt to impose a mandatory reduction on farmers would be totally opposed by IFA. “We have seen the difficulties this has created with the BEAM Scheme. It seems the Dept has failed to learn any lessons from this. While any funding is welcome, I am concerned that it will not be enough to stop departures from the sector. We are in real danger of losing a whole sector,” he said.

Lakeland Milk Price Management Scheme Penalising Farmers
IFA Dairy Chairman Stephen Arthur said it’s really disappointing to see a scheme unduly penalising farmers for producing milk at the most economically favourable time of the year, especially with spiralling input costs. “Milk produced from grazed grass is our competitive advantage here in Ireland and this must be prioritised at all times.”
This proposed scheme from Lakeland Dairies raises a number of serious questions. First and foremost, why is there a need for this scheme to be launched at a time when milk supply is back in Ireland and globally, with spiralling input costs, this trend looks likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

IFA Extends Contract of Director General
The IFA has extended the contract of its Director General Damian McDonald. In line with current employment regulations, the contract is of indefinite duration, with a clause agreed to end the contract, should it be required.
The Organisation’s Remuneration Committee reviewed the salary of the Director General. It decided it would increase to €215,998 in line with the pay scale for the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Committee also reviewed the salaries of the positions of President and Deputy President. These salaries have remained the same since 2016. These salaries will now increase to €140,000 and €40,000, respectively.
IFA Welcomes Extension to Deadline for Nitrates Derogation Application
IFA Environment Chair Paul O’Brien has welcomed the extension to the 2022 Nitrates Derogation application deadline until midnight Friday, April 22nd.
“The extra week will provide much needed time for farmers wishing to apply for a derogation to gather and prepare the information required to submit the online application,” he said.

Horticulture Aid Package Needs Further Clarification
IFA Field Vegetable and Protected Crops Vice Chairman Martin Flynn said the Govt aid package for horticulture is a positive step, but soft fruit growers have been excluded. 
“The package falls short of what is needed, given the huge input surge in the sector. In addition, it appears soft fruit growers have been inexplicably excluded. Soft fruit growers do not appear to be included and IFA is looking for clarity on this. The soft fruit sector is worth approx. €51m at farm gate. The producers are struggling with the same level of inflationary input costs as all other sectors. They must be included for funding under the proposed scheme,” he said.

Increase in TAMS Investment Limit to €200,000 Important for Poultry Farms
Poultry
IFA Poultry Chairman Nigel Sweetnam said the decision to increase the TAMS investment limit on poultry farms to €200,000 will help farmers upgrade their farms. He said IFA had campaigned for the increase to better reflect the scale of investment needed on farms. The existing limit was €80,000.
“Given the very real income difficulties on poultry farms at the moment, every support has to be made available to farmers. TAMS is an important scheme which allows farmers to improve their production system,” he said.

Farmers Cannot be Left in Limbo on Inputs Crisis
IFA National Farm Business Chair Rose Mary McDonagh said farmers across all sectors are being hit by an array of spiralling input costs, which are eroding already low margins for most. Aggregate agricultural output prices rose 19.2% in February vs. 2021 levels, but aggregate input prices rose by over 28%, with increases in certain fertilisers (+180%); fuel (+38.5%); feed (+20%) and electricity (+22%). “It’s simply just not sustainable at current levels. Farmers cannot be left in limbo and expected to carry on regardless, to simply suck up the uncertainty and take the losses to ensure food security for Irish consumers. Many operations will simply go out of business if nothing changes soon,” she said.

Funding is available for up to 40,000 farmers to participate this year.  However, the IFA Animal Health Chair said the TASAH needs to be expanded to reward farmers for taking part.

Latest Market Reports
Beef Market Update
IFA livestock chairman Brendan Golden said beef price rises in our key export markets and in particular the EU market are not being reflected in the prices factories are offering farmers.He said while prices continue to creep up 5c/kg a week the price surge for young bulls on the continent and price increases in the UK are leaving our prices lagging behind the prime export benchmark price by over 30c/kg on the latest report. The IFA livestock chairman said factories must reflect the buoyant market conditions for Irish beef in the UK and EU markets by closing the gap with the export benchmark price.

Sheep Market Update
IFA Sheep committee chairman Kevin Comiskey said factory prices for hoggets and spring lamb are not reflecting the increased production costs on sheep farms.He said prices are currently running up to 30c/kg below last year for hoggets and must push on. Prices in the UK and France have shown strong growth over the past few weeks reflecting market demand for sheep meat.Kevin Comiskey said factories must come forward with significant price increases to reflect market conditions and the investment of sheep farmers in producing hoggets and spring lamb at this time of year.
Pig Market Update
Irish pig price increased this week by 6c/kg. Farmers are receiving quotes of €1.66c/kg up to €1.70 or €1.72 – €1.76/kg. Farmers welcome this upward movement but need more significant movement for the price they receive for their pigs urgently to slow the haemorrhaging of money they have endured.

Potato Market Update
Markets remain largely unchanged at present; the Easter bank holiday created some additional demand in the food service sector. Recent dry weather has allowed good progress on maincrop preparations and plantings at this point. More growers are reported to be finished in the south east. Again, growers are reminded to plant for their individual markets as markets continue to re- configure post covid.

IFA Livestock Committee chairman Brendan Golden said demand for beef in our key export markets continues to drive the trade. He said supplies are failing to meet demand and factories are ringing around trying to get cattle for immediate slaughter.
Brendan Golden said UK prices rose again this week and combined with the EU price are resting 16c/kg above our price in the Prime Export Benchmark measure highlighting the opportunity for further and stronger beef price increases. 
Supplies of cattle in the UK are continuing at 6% below last year’s levels providing real opportunity for Irish beef to fill this deficit in a high-priced market. Brendan Golden said market conditions and availability of beef justify strong beef price growth and farmers should sell hard in a rising market.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Committee chairman Kevin Comiskey said reducing supplies of hoggets has underpinned the spring lamb trade as factories actively seek out supplies. He said good quality hoggets are making €7.50/kg and as numbers tighten demand for spring lambs is increasing in all factories. The IFA Sheep chairman said numbers of spring lamb available are extremely tight, running almost 10,000 behind last years levels to-date which is pushing factories into offering deals on weights to 20.5kg with prices of €8.40/kg common place. He said spring lamb prices must push on to reflect the input cost exposure on sheep farms and factories must be more flexible on weights. Kevin Comiskey said demand for cull ewes is very strong with prices of €4.00/kg and above paid by factories. He said farmers should sell hard while moving hoggets and lambs as they become fit.
Lamb Price Update 12/05/2022
Hogget €7.20/7.50/kg. Spring lamb €8.10/8.40/kg. Higher deals groups/larger lots. Ewes €3.80/4.00/kg.
